# `abi.encodePacked` should stop to be used since there are conversions around to deprecate it in future versions of Solidity

## Summary
`abi.encodePacked()` will be removed according to Solidity guide https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11593
Also it will cause vulnerability in case of future update where you add dynamic types as arguments. Described in here https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
`abi.encodePacked` will behaviour unexpectedly in case of future Solidity update and should not be used.
It will break the MerkleProof check if you add dynamic types in leaf argument in next protocol upgrade.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `abi.encode()` or `bytes.concat()` instead of `abi.encodePacked`.
