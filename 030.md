# ABI.ENCODEPACKED() should not be used with dynamic types when passing the result to a hash function such as KECCAK256(),might cause hash collisions

## Summary
ABI.ENCODEPACKED()  should not be used with dynamic types when passing the result to a hash function such as KECCAK256() Use abi.encode(), instead which will pad items to 32 bytes, which will prevent hash collisions.

## Vulnerability Detail
From the solidity documentation:
https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/abi-spec.html?highlight=collisions#non-standard-packed-mode
> If you use keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a, b)) and both a and b are dynamic types, it is easy to craft collisions in the hash value by moving parts of a into b and vice-versa. More specifically, abi.encodePacked("a", "bc") == abi.encodePacked("ab", "c").

This issue exists in the MarginTradingFactory contract can results in hash collisions.

## Impact
The getCreateMarginTradingAddress and createMarginTrading functionalities might be effected due to hash collisions due to external arguments being passed by the user.

## Code Snippet
The issue is in these lines of code:

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use abi.encode() instead
