# _closetrade would revert on some ERC20 tokens withdrawn

## Summary

_closetrade would revert on some ERC20 tokens withdrawn.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some widely used ERC20 tokens (USDT for example) include approval race protection, which requires the old approval value to be 0 if the new approval value isn't:
```solidity 
    function approve(address _spender, uint _value) public onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) {

        // To change the approve amount you first have to reduce the addresses`
        //  allowance to zero by calling `approve(_spender, 0)` if it is not
        //  already 0 to mitigate the race condition described here:
        //  https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729
        require(!((_value != 0) && (allowed[msg.sender][_spender] != 0)));

        allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    }
```

At the same time `MarginTrading.sol` includes several calls to approve with non-zero values during user flow. First-time approval probably would be called during _lendingPoolDeposit() call, leaving the approval value close to uint256.max after deposit:
```solidity
File: MarginTrading.sol
374:     function _lendingPoolDeposit(address _asset, uint256 _amount, uint8 _flag) internal {
375:         _approveToken(address(lendingPool), _asset, _amount);
376:         lendingPool.deposit(_asset, _amount, address(this), Types.REFERRAL_CODE);
377:         emit LendingPoolDeposit(_asset, _amount, _flag);
378:     }
...
392:     function _approveToken(address _address, address _tokenAddress, uint256 _tokenAmount) internal {
393:         if (IERC20(_tokenAddress).allowance(address(this), _address) < _tokenAmount) {
394:             IERC20(_tokenAddress).approve(_address, type(uint256).max); trusted 
395:         }
396:     }
```

Second-time approval would be called (and this call is unnecessary for successful execution) during the flash-loan execution of position full closure:
```solidity
File: MarginTrading.sol
328:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < _withdrawAssets.length; i++) {
329:             _lendingPoolWithdraw(_withdrawAssets[i], _withdrawAmounts[i], 1);
330:             IERC20(_withdrawAssets[i]).approve(address(lendingPool), _withdrawAmounts[i]);
331:         }
```

This would lead to reverting inside approval call for such token as USDT.
Also note that the `MarginTrading.sol` includes unnecessary approval inside the `_lendingPoolWithdraw()` function, since tokens are withdrawing from `lendingPool` there is no need to approve them here.

## Impact

Users would be unable to withdraw some ERC20 tokens using executeFlashLoans() function.

## PoC 
To demonstrate failure on flash-loan with such tokens, `MockERC20` from tests should be updated:
```solidity
File: MockERC20.sol
49:     function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
+           require(!((amount != 0) && (allowed[msg.sender][spender] != 0)), "Already approved non zero");
50:         allowed[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
51:         emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
52:         return true;
53:     }
```

Now the execution of test `testProxyExecuteFlashLoansAllClose` would fail:
```solidity
forge test -m testExecuteFlashLoansAllClose -vvv
```

## Code Snippet

Approve would be called inside executeFlashLoans() a second time after initial approval in _lendingPoolDeposit():

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove no needed approvals on line 330 and inside the _lendingPoolWithdraw() function.
