# IERC20 transfer calls may silently fail

## Summary

Some ERC20 tokens do not revert on failed transfer. Therefore the return value of `transfer` calls should be checked.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some ERC20 tokens to do not revert on a failed transfer. Therefore the unchecked transfer calls silently fail in this contract. This can lead to Tokens being left in the contract, which the user has to claim again, which costs more gas.

## Impact

Transactions succeed, even if transfer failed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check the return value of `transfer`or use `safeTransfer` from `SafeERC20` instead.
`safeTransfer` will revert on a return value of `false`.
