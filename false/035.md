# Any user will be able to execute executeFlashLoans function when isAllowedProxy is set to true

## Summary
The modifier onlyFlashLoan() in MarginTrading contract will always return true, if isAllowedProxy is set to true for the user address,
which fails the onlyFlashLoan() modifier used in the executeFlashLoans() function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The executeFlashLoans() function can be executed by any attaker, as the onlyFlashLoan() modifier becomes irrelevant once the isAllowedProxy is set to true for the user address as the onlyFlashLoan() modifier only checks the OR condition and fails everytime isAllowedProxy will return true.

## Impact
Attacker can expolit this vulnerability and execute the flash loans( ).

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The new modifier should be added to the executeFlashLoans() function to verify the proxy address that is allowed to execute flashloans.
