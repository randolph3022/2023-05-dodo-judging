# _lendingPoolWithdraw should not call _approveToken

## Summary
Inside of MarginTrading.sol, the _lendingPoolWithdraw inner function which is called by Withdraw functions, calls _approveToken to lending pool. This means that to Withdraw tokens, the contracts needs to have an allowance of these tokens and have to approve them to the lending pool, before it can withdraw them. This doesn't make sense.

## Vulnerability Detail
withdrawERC20 calls _lendingPoolWithdraw, _lendingPoolWithdraw calls _approveToken. If the contract doesn't have high enough allowance, the transaction will revert, tokens will be stuck in lendingPool.

## Impact
loss of funds/tokens/ protocol not working as intended.
