# Dodo approve mechanism will not work with USDT

## Summary
Dodo approve mechanism will not work with USDT as it requires previous approve to be nullified before new approve
## Vulnerability Detail
In several places in the code `MarginTrading` contract approves uint256.max amount of tokens.
For example [inside `_opentrade` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L267). So in case if token is usdt, then after the first approve, interaction with token will stop working and next approve will revert. Trading with usdt will be not possible anymore.
## Impact
It will be not possible to trade with usdt.
## Code Snippet
Provided above
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You need to reset approval before setting it again for usdt.
