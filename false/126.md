# Approve logic not compatible with all tokens, will lead to revert inside the _swapAproveToken loop from _openTrade and _closeTrade functions

## Summary
Approve logic inside the loop of functions _closeTrade & _openTrade from MaringTrading will result in a revert with the tokens that don't support approve max, like UNI, COMP or need to first approve to 0, like USDT 

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

Tokens that don't support approve type(uint256).max amount, like UNI, COMP etc.... ,  will create a revert in the [_closeTrade](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/930565dd875dac24609441423c7c76c2ae4719a8/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#LL309C27-L309C27) & [_openTrade](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/930565dd875dac24609441423c7c76c2ae4719a8/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L267) functions, also the tokens like USDT, where you need to first approve to 0, to be able to re-approve again will cause a revert, as there could be multiple repetitive calls in that _closeTrade loop that can call the approve max on USDT one after another, not necessary in the same block but result will be the same, a revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Keep it simple, first approve to 0 and then only approve the necessary values and not the max amounts.

```solidity
 for (uint256 i = 0; i < _swapApproveToken.length; i++) {
                IERC20(_swapApproveToken[i]).approve(_swapApproveTarget, 0;
                IERC20(_swapApproveToken[i]).approve(_swapApproveTarget, amountToBeApproved[i]);
            }
```
