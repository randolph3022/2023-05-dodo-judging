# Consider using `safeTransfer` instead of `transfer`

## Summary
Consider using `safeTransfer` instead of `transfer`

## Vulnerability Detail
In `MarginTrading` you use `ERC20.transfer` for transferring funds:

Some of ERC20 tokens may not revert on unsuccessful transfer, but just return `false` instead:

## Impact
If the `MarginTrading` contract is managed not by EOA but by another contract, such "silent fails" would make a mess and may lead to calculation errors in the owner contract, when it "withdraws" funds and sees that the tx is successful (but the funds are actually not sent because of some error).

## Recommendation
Consider using `SafeERC20.safeTransfer` function instead.
