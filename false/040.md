Access Control Issue causing undesired behavior

## Vulnerability Detail

With that, you can bypass the check to make sure only the specified `USER` can add flash loan proxies: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTradingFactory.sol#L94-L97
