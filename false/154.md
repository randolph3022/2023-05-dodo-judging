# No address(0) check or return check.

## Summary
The _lendingPoolDeposit and Deposit functions lack checks for validating the asset address and ensuring successful token transfer. This may allow a user to deposit an unsupported or worthless token and artificially inflate their aToken balance.


## Vulnerability Detail
In the _lendingPoolDeposit and Deposit functions, there is no validation to ensure the provided asset address is a supported token or even a valid address. This means a user could potentially deposit a random, worthless ERC20 token or even the zero address, and receive a significant amount of aTokens in return.

A user exploiting this vulnerability could use the inflated aToken balance to yield farm or borrow valuable assets, leading to significant impact on the protocol's integrity and functionality.

Additionally, there is no check to ensure the transferFrom operation is successful, potentially leading to false-positive deposits.

## Impact
1. Exploitation of lending and borrowing system: Users could deposit worthless tokens and receive aTokens, which could then be used as collateral to borrow valuable assets.

2. Artificial Inflation of TVL: An exploiter could significantly inflate the protocol's Total Value Locked (TVL), potentially misleading users and investors about the protocol's liquidity and overall health.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement checks to validate the asset address in the deposit functions:

Ensure the asset is not the zero address.
Ensure the asset is a supported and approved token within the protocol.
Implement a check to handle the return value of the transferFrom function to ensure the token transfer is successful.
