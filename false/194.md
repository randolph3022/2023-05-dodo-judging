# MarginTrading.sol#L365 : Not checking the valid amount of transfer is not safe.

## Summary

During [_lendingPoolWithdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#LL363C14-L363C34) does no check the valid amount of withdrawal.

## Vulnerability Detail

During _lendingPoolWithdraw call, following will happen.

1. approve x amount of tokens.
2. withdraw the assets to contract address.

    null(address _asset, uint256 _amount, uint8 _flag) internal {
        _approveToken(address(lendingPool), _asset, _amount);
        lendingPool.withdraw(_asset, _amount, address(this));
        emit LendingPoolWithdraw(_asset, _amount, _flag);
    }

## Impact

When lending pool is unavailable or it has less amount of funds, withdraw can not happen.
Though there is no actual withdrawal, contract still think the withdrawal happens and proceed for further transaction.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check valid amount of withdraw

    null(address _asset, uint256 _amount, uint8 _flag) internal {
        _approveToken(address(lendingPool), _asset, _amount);
        lendingPool.withdraw(_asset, _amount, address(this)); --------------- ???
        uint amount = lendingPool.withdraw(_asset, _amount, address(this));  ---------------------> +++++++
        require(amount > 0);
        emit LendingPoolWithdraw(_asset, _amount, _flag);
    }
