# No way to remove elements from crossMarginTrading and isolatedMarginTrading mapping

## Summary
Currently, there is no way to remove elements from crossMarginTrading and isolatedMarginTrading mappings.
## Vulnerability Detail
Every time a user creates for himself a crossMarginTrading or isolatedMarginTrading account, a new element is pushed in the crossMarginTrading/isolatedMarginTrading mapping.

However, currently there is no way to remove elements from the mappings. Creating a margin contract is not expensive at all and a malicious user could create a large number of trading contracts, making it very expensive or impossible to work with the crossMarginTrading and/or isolatedMarginTrading mappings.

```solidity
 function createMarginTrading(/*params*/) {
        if (_flag == 1) {
            
            crossMarginTrading[msg.sender].push(marginTrading);
       
        }
        if (_flag == 2) {
           
            isolatedMarginTrading[msg.sender].push(marginTrading);

        }
``` 
## Impact
crossMarginTrading and/or isolatedMarginTrading becoming too big and expensive to work with. Potentially leading to DOS somewhere else in the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a way to remove elements from the mappings. 
Potentially, you can also limit the number of trading contracts a user can create. This will not mitigate the attack fully but will make it harder.
