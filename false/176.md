# Unnecessary `_approveToken` in `MarginTrading._lendingPoolWithdraw()`.


## Summary

In `MarginTrading._lendingPoolWithdraw`, it calls `_approveToken` before calling `lendingPool.withdraw`. However, it doesn’t need to approve first before withdrawing the asset from the aave lending pool. Moreover, it shows an opportunity that the asset can be used to open another position. 

## Vulnerability Detail

`_lendingPoolWithdraw` calls `_approveToken` before calling `lendingPool.withdraw`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L364
```solidity
    function _lendingPoolWithdraw(address _asset, uint256 _amount, uint8 _flag) internal {
        _approveToken(address(lendingPool), _asset, _amount);
        lendingPool.withdraw(_asset, _amount, address(this));
        emit LendingPoolWithdraw(_asset, _amount, _flag);
    }
```

But `lendingPool.withdraw` doesn’t need to approve `_asset` first.
https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/master/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L142

And calling `MarginTrading.lendingPoolWithdraw` doesn’t actually withdraw the asset back. The asset stays in `MarginTrading`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L172
```solidity
    function lendingPoolWithdraw(address _asset, uint256 _amount, uint8 _flag) external onlyUser {
        _lendingPoolWithdraw(_asset, _amount, _flag);
    }
```

Since the asset stays in `MarginTrading`. And it is approved to the aave lending pool. An approved proxy user can use it to open another position by calling `MarginTrading.executeFlashLoans` when the user of `MarginTrading` doesn’t want to open a position but taking back the asset.


## Impact

Since `MarginTrading.executeFlashLoans` can be called by not only the `_USER` but also the proxy user approved by the user. The proxy user can use the wrongly-approved asset to open another position.
