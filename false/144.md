# Ensure function to `receive()` has logic to return funds to the user when `withdrawETH` fallbacks

## Summary
Ensure function to `receive()` has logic to return funds to the user when `withdrawETH` fallbacks 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `receive()` function needs to have fallback logic in the method and it should be not empty. It must have logic for returning Ether to the user.

## Impact
Fallback logic on receive method will not do anything but only receive the amount and do nothing with it. 
This happens when initiated transfer in `withdrawETH` and when happened unexpected behavior and failed the receive function is called.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
  receive() external payable {}
```
