# Unrecoverable Ether locking in contracts

# Ether can be locked in the MarginTradingFactory and MarginTrading contract without no way to retrieve it


## Summary

Empty `receive()` functions in both contracts can lead to users losing their eth.


## Vulnerability Detail

`MarginTradingFactory` contract turns Ether into WETH and then sends it to `MarginTrading` contract. There are empty block `receive()` functions in both `MarginTrading` and `MarginTradingFactory` which enables users to send arbitrary amounts of eth in the hope that it is used as their margin, although their eth is locked in the contracts without the ability to withdraw it.
No need for the payable modifier in withdrawETH function in MarginTrading contract either as it does not have anything to do with the `msg.value` . 

```solidity
    function withdrawETH(bool _margin, uint256 _marginAmount, uint8 _flag) external payable onlyUser {
        if (_margin) {
            _lendingPoolWithdraw(address(WETH), _marginAmount, _flag);
        }
        WETH.withdraw(_marginAmount);
        _safeTransferETH(msg.sender, _marginAmount);
        emit WithdrawETH(_marginAmount, _margin, _flag);
    }
```

```solidity
    function _safeTransferETH(address to, uint256 value) internal {
        (bool success,) = to.call{value: value}(new bytes(0));
        require(success, "ETH_TRANSFER_FAILED");
    }
```

## Impact

Arbitrary amounts of ether can be locked in the contract without a way to retrieve them.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add this in receive functions:

```solidity
assert(msg.sender == WETH); // only accept ETH via fallback from the WETH contract
```
And remove the payable modifier of withdrawEth function.
