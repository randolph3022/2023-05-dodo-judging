# Operation Flags can be misappropriated

## Summary

Operation flags that used in various functions can be misappropriated

## Vulnerability Detail

Operation flags that are used in various functions - `depositMarginTradingERC20`, `depositMarginTradingETH`, `lendingPoolRepay`, `lendingPoolDeposit`, `_lendingPoolWithdraw` etc. - are emitted in events to keep track of which type of calls are performed. However this params are not used in anywhere and not checked. 

This issue will allow users to call these functions in contract with whatever flag they choose and will mess up with any metric or third party/off-chain component. Since there is not any documentation around how these flags are used, exact impact is unknown to auditors.

## Impact

Operations will be misappropriated, more serious/unknown impacts can be expected.
