# Unnecessary receive() for MarginTradingFactory

## Summary
There is unnecessary receive() to accept ETH inside MarginTradingFactory, needlessly adding exposure for someone's funds being trapped. 

## Vulnerability Detail
MarginTradingFactory does not need to `receive()` for accepting ETH since all actions are being done in WETH only.
Hence accepting ETH needlessly requires the DODO team to add a function for rescuing trapped eth.

## Impact
Someone can trap ETH inside the factory by mistake, and then wait for the DODO team to rescue it.

## Recommendation
