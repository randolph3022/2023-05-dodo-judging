# ETH could be blocked, if owner of MarginTrading.sol is contract, without receive() payable

## Summary
ETH could be blocked, if owner of MarginTrading.sol is contract, without receive() payable functnion
## Vulnerability Detail
MarginTrading contract has function withdrawETH, which allow owner withdraw weth tokens from trading, like real ETH.
```solidity
// MarginTrading.sol 
 function withdrawETH(bool _margin, uint256 _marginAmount, uint8 _flag) external payable onlyUser 
  if (_margin) {
            _lendingPoolWithdraw(address(WETH), _marginAmount, _flag);
        }
        WETH.withdraw(_marginAmount);
        _safeTransferETH(msg.sender, _marginAmount); // <------
        emit WithdrawETH(_marginAmount, _margin, _flag);
    }
```
this function call internal function  _safeTransferETH(address to, uint256 value)
```solidity
function _safeTransferETH(address to, uint256 value) internal {
        (bool success,) = to.call{value: value}(new bytes(0));
        require(success, "ETH_TRANSFER_FAILED");
    }
```
_safeTransferETH has parameter "address to", but it always = msg.sender, because this function calls only from withdrawETH function.

If User (owner of this contract) - smart contract, which dont has function receive() payable, he could not receive ETH, TX will revert. The problem is, that function withdrawETH dont allow specify receiver address for ETH and send eth always  to msg.sender.
## Impact
User could not receive eth from MarginTrading contract's balance. ETH is blocked on the balance of the contract forever
