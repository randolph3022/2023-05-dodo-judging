# If tokens like USDT are supported, they may silently fail and revert on approval for margin account

## Summary
DODO on the contest page mentions that they are not looking to support tokens like USDT, however, their contract has SafeERC20 incorrectly used.
Hence, I am not sure about the protocol team's intention.
If they are looking to support tokens like USDT, they may silently fail or revert on approval

## Vulnerability Detail
DODO on the contest page clearly states that they are looking to support WETH, USDC, WBTC, DAI, and MATIC

> Q: Which ERC20 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts?
> WETH USDC WBTC DAI MATIC

**None of these mentioned tokens have weird properties to be handled separately, if that's the intention, feel free to close this issue.** 
**However, I do see DODO incorrectly using the SafeERC20 library here.**

DODO has only declared it but is not using the library methods like safe transfer in place of transfer, making the initial declaration meaningless.

If DODO's intention is to allow tokens like USDT, both safe transfer and conditional approval (on basis of current allowance) need to be implemented.
In my opinion, since USDT is supported on AAVE, ideally DODO should look to support it as well.

## Impact
Silent Fails in the case of tokens like USDT
Revert in case of USDT approvals if there is already a nonzero allowance

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If you are not looking to support tokens like USDT, remove the SafeERC20 declaration.
If you are looking to support it, add safeTransfer and conditional approval
