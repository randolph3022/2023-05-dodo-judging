# ERC20 tokens that require 0 allowances before approval can get locked

## Summary

ERC20 tokens that require 0 allowances before approval can get locked.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens revert in `approve` if the current allowance is not 0. 
[Code from USDT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code):
```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint _value) public onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) {
    // To change the approve amount you first have to reduce the addresses`
    //  allowance to zero by calling `approve(_spender, 0)` if it is not
    //  already 0 to mitigate the race condition described here:
    //  https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729
    require(!((_value != 0) && (allowed[msg.sender][_spender] != 0)));

    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
}
```

## Impact

Tokens that require zero approval will fail after the first interaction and might be locked in the lending pool.

## Proof of concept

The user deposits USDT in the lending pool via `lendingPoolDeposit`. The token gets approved for `_amount`.

The user tries to withdraw the USDT from the lending pool via `lendingPoolWithdraw`, and when trying to approve the amount to be withdrawn it will revert.
```solidity
    function _lendingPoolWithdraw(address _asset, uint256 _amount, uint8 _flag) internal {
        _approveToken(address(lendingPool), _asset, _amount);
        lendingPool.withdraw(_asset, _amount, address(this));
        emit LendingPoolWithdraw(_asset, _amount, _flag);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Approve to amount 0 first:
```diff
+   IERC20(_tokenAddress).approve(_address, 0);
    IERC20(_tokenAddress).approve(_address, type(uint256).max);
```
