# MarginTradingFactory.sol : Contract does not user the SafeERC20, though it is inherited

## Summary

`MarginTradingFactory.sol` contract inherits the SafeERC20 from openzeppalin. I think, this has done to avoid any  unexpected failures with ERC20 token transfer. But the SafeERC20 is not used.

The contract does some ERC20 token transfers.

## Vulnerability Detail

Inherits the SafeERC20 in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTradingFactory.sol#L5

Uses the ERC20 transfer call here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTradingFactory.sol#L206-L218

## Impact

Funds can be lost when contract can not accept the transaction.
one scenario where this can happen this can happen due to out of gas run.
When huge sum of transfer happens, failure at that stage could cause considerable amount of loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the SafeERC20 as shown below.

    contract MarginTradingFactory is Ownable, IMarginTradingFactory {
    null(address _tokenAddress, address _to, uint256 _amount);

    null(address _to, uint256 _amount);

    using SafeERC20 for IERC20; ------------------------->>>>>>>>> add this line, and use the ERC20 typecase where token transfer happens

    address public immutable MARGIN_TRADING_TEMPLATE;
    address internal LendingPool;
    IWETH internal WETH;
    IDODOApprove internal DODOApprove;
    // user => approveAddress = > bool
    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) public ALLOWED_FLASH_LOAN;
