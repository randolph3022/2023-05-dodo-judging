# arbitrary malicious function call

## Summary
insufficient parameter checking leading to arbitrary function call
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    null(bytes[] calldata data) public payable returns (bytes[] memory results) {
        results = new bytes[](data.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(data[i]);

            if (!success) {
                assembly {
                    revert(add(result, 32), mload(result))
                }
            }

            results[i] = result;
        }
    }
```
According to the comments, the multicall function should invoke multiple functions of the current contract. However, this function does not check the data parameter and its visibility is public, so any user can call this function and invoke any function of any other contract through delegatecall. This is very dangerous as it allows malicious users to call uncontrollable functions, which can result in significant loss of funds or even self-destruction of the contract.
## Impact
This can lead to significant loss of funds or even the self-destruction of the contract.
