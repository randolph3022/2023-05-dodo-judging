# If a user gets blacklisted from usdc,they wont be able to withdraw usdc

## Summary
Since `_USER` is a variable but there is no way to  change the address, so if the address gets blacklisted it won't be able to withdraw usdc and it will be stuck in the contract 
## Vulnerability Detail
`withdrawERC20` has `onlyUser` modifier so when the user gets blacklisted, the only to call this function is the user and since the blacklist is very possible the usdc can get stuck in the contract and there is no way for the user to get their funds out.
## Impact
stuck funds 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    address private _USER;

    modifier onlyUser() {
        require(_USER == msg.sender, "caller is not the user");
//different part of code
        IERC20(_marginAddress).transfer(msg.sender, _marginAmount);
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
have the function to change the user address
for have  separate function for the owner to withdraw funds
