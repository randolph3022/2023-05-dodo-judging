# Unnecessary approve to all Tokens instead of only required amount

## Summary

ERC20 `approve` is called inconsistently and in an unsafe way inside the MarginTrading contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

Every, except 1, call to `approve` is approving `type(uint256).max` (all) tokens, instead of only the required amount. This unnecessarily grants too much permissoion on the contracts, that are approved.

E.g. if there is a vulnerability in one of the approved contracts, an attacker might be able to steal all the tokens, instead of only the required amount.

## Impact

Unneccessary higher risk for the tokens approved.
