# ## ERC20 return values not checked

## Summary
The ERC20.transfer()  function return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

## Vulnerability Detail
Using unsafe ERC20 methods can roll back the transaction for certain tokens.
## Impact
Tokens that don’t actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer and the tokens remain in the  contract and could potentially be stolen by someone els

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend using OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
