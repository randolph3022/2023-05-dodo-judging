# XDZIBEC-"Unchecked External Contract Calls"

## Summary

the lack of access control for the mint function is vulnerable, which allows anyone to add an arbitrary `amount `of `tokens` to any `address` without any `restrictions`. 
This can be exploited by an attacker to inflate the` token` supply and devalue it. 
To address this issue, access control measures such as a role-based access control system should be implemented to restrict the `mint `function to `authorized` users only

## Vulnerability Detail

It is possible for a malicious can act in the contract cause is missing access control for some functions in L59
 In particular, the `mint` function can be called by anyone without any restrictions, allowing an arbitrary `amount `of tokens to be added to an `arbitrary address`. 
This creates a potential attack vector where an attacker can inflate the total supply of the token and devalue it:

   ```solidity
 function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external {
        balances[account] = balances[account] + amount;
    }

    // comment this function out because Ethersjs cannot tell two functions with same name
    // function mint(uint256 amount) external {
    //     balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] + amount;
    // }
```
An attacker could repeatedly call the `mint` function to create a large number of tokens, which they can then use to manipulate the market and benefit from the devaluation of the` token`. This can cause significant harm to the token's ecosystem and its users

we can demonstrate the cost of the attack that exploits the vulnerability in the smart contract:

```python
// Attacker's address
address attacker = <attacker_address>;

// Target contract instance
MyToken target = MyToken(<target_contract_address>);

// Mint a large amount of tokens to the attacker's address
target.mint(attacker, 1000000000000000000000);
```
the code assumes that the` mint` function in the `MyToken` contract is not properly secured with access control and can be called by anyone. By calling the `mint` function with a large amount of `tokens`, the attacker can inflate the total supply of the` token` and devalue it.

## Impact

An attacker can exploit it to inflate the total supply of the token and devalue it, causing significant financial losses for `token` holders. By calling the `mint` function with an arbitrary address and an arbitrary amount of tokens, the attacker can add `tokens` to any account without any restrictions or authorization, which can lead to market manipulation and loss of investor confidence.

## Recommendation

to fix this vulnerability, access control should be added to the` mint()` function to restrict it only to authorized users. One way to do this is by implementing a role-based access control (RBAC) system, where only specific addresses with the appropriate role can call the `mint()` function.
