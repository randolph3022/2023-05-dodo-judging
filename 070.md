# Anyone can steal MarginTradingFactory's ether via MarginTradingFactory.multicall

## Summary

`MarginTradingFactory.multicall` uses `address(this).delegatecall` to call any method of itself in a loop. The context of the delegatecall  comes from the caller. **`msg.value` can be reused in the loop**. MarginTradingFactory implements `receive()` to receive ether, and `cleanETH` allows owner to withdraw ether. So this issue needs to be known by the sponsor.

## Vulnerability Detail

Suppose `MarginTradingFactory` has 10e18 ether. Bob created his MarginTrading A via `MarginTradingFactory.createMarginTrading`, no deposit, no execution. The `data` parameter of the `multicall` function is as follows:

- data[0] = abi.encodeWithSignature("depositMarginTradingETH(address,bool,uint8)", A, false, 0);
- data[1] = data[0];

bob initiates a call: `MarginTradingFactory.multicall{value: 10 ether}(data)`. Then there is 20e18 weth in A. Finally, bob calls  `A.withdrawETH(false, 20e18, 0)` to get 20e18 ether.

## Impact

Anyone can steal MarginTradingFactory's ether.
