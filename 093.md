# Anyone can drain all of the user funds from margin account using external flashloan

## Summary
Anyone can pass the margin account address as a receiver address for flashloan() directly on aave's lending pool and drain all of the user funds

## Vulnerability Detail
The expected execution flow in the case of Dodo's margin trading account is 

User/Owner/AllowedProxy calls: 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L89
```solidity
executeFlashLoans() >
address receiverAddress = address(this)
lendingPool.flashLoan(receiverAddress, assets, amounts, modes, onBehalfOf, params, Types.REFERRAL_CODE);
```
And then LendingPool calls  `executeOperation()` back on receiverAddress=marginAccountAddress with params

DODO do verify if `executeOperation()` is called by the lending pool only, however, they fail to consider that user can initiate flashloan with the receiver address as the margin account address directly on the lending pool as well.

Doing so allows attackers to pass anything as params and execute arbitrary actions on behalf of users.
In the worst case using `_swapApproveToken` as their own address in case of open or close trade, an attacker can give them infinite token approval, and then drain the margin account.

The attacker has other ways of draining the account as well since there is no verification on params passed, like ``_swapAddress``

This is a widely known issue in the case of aave flashloan receivers and has affected some MEV bots recently.

## Impact
An attacker can drain all of the user funds from the margin trading account

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider checking the initiator of flashloan callback inside `executeOperation`, and revert if it's not equal to the user/owner/allowedProxy of the margin account
