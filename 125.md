# Approvals to the lending pool cannot be revoked

## Summary

Approvals to the lending pool cannot be revoked.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `MarginTrading.sol` the `LendingPool` contract is approved for max `uint256` when performing a deposit, repayment, or withdrawal. However, there is no way to revoke those approvals.

Although the `LendingPool` contract is trusted and managed by a reputed protocol as is AAVE, the fact that is an upgradable contract that can be subject to changes approved by the protocol should be reason enough to provide a means for revoking approvals to `LendingPool` in case changes in the contract can put at risk the tokens approved.

Note also that the approval for withdrawal is unnecessary.

## Impact

In case of `LendingPool` being hacked or updated with exploitable code, the total balance of all tokens approved by `MarginTrading` will be at risk.
