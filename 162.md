# Unchecked ERC20 token transfer can cause locking of funds.

## Summary
Unchecked ERC20 token transfer can locking of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are several instances of unchecked ERC20 transfers throughout MarginTradingFactory.sol and MarginTrading.sol

## Impact

Funds could potentially be bricked in the case of successful operations followed by failed transfer of tokens to the user in MarginTrading's `withdrawERC20` and `_closeTrade`.

The instance in MarginTradingFactory's `cleanToken` is less impactful (simply call the function again) but its eth equivalent has a transfer check and SafeERC20 is imported, so you might as well use it.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check for successful transfer. 

Both files import SafeERC20, but it's never used. MarginTrading correctly has `using SafeERC20 for IERC20;` but the contract still uses `transfer`. Switch all of the IERC20 transfers to `safeTransfer` to make use of that library's transfer with built in check for success.

MarginTradingFactory is the same, except it needs `using SafeERC20 for IERC20;` added to its code. The file is already imported. And then switch the transfers to `safeTransfer`
