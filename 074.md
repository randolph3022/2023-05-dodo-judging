# Any MarginTrading contract that has AToken will suffer funds loss

## Summary

`MarginTrading._lendingPoolDeposit` deposits token into the `lendingPool`, and `lendingPool` returns the corresponding AToken to MarginTrading.Â AToken will be held in MarginTrading for a while:

1.  Users will not withdraw AToken.
2.  The user withdraws AToken as a separate tx.

## Vulnerability Detail

For simplicity, assume a scenario: Alice creates her MarginTrading A, and calls `A.lendingPoolDeposit` to deposit 100e18 weth, lendingPool returns some corresponding ATokens to A. Bob deploys a contract B. The steps are as follows:

1.  B initiates `lendingPool.flashLoan` to lend 0 weth For A. The parameters are as follows:
    
    - receiverAddress = A
    - assets[0] = weth
    - amounts[0] = 0
    - modes[0] = 0
    - onBehalfOf = A
    - params, this parameter is important, it will be explained in the following decoding.
    - referralCode = 0
2.  lendingPool callbacks to `A.executeOperation`. The parameters are as follows:
    
    - _assets[0] = weth
    - _amounts[0] = 0
    - _premiums[0] = 0
    - _initiator = B
    - _params, this is the parameter passed in the 1 step, constructed by B.
3.  decode _params. The result is as follows:
    
    - _flag = 1
        
    - _swapAddress = lendingPool
        
    - _swapApproveTarget = lendingPool, this parameter can be ignored.
        
    - _swapApproveToken[0] = weth, this parameter can be ignored.
        
    - _swapParams = abi.encodeWithSignature("withdraw(address,uint256,address)", weth, ATokenAmount, B), withdraw function comes from lendingPool.
        
    - _tradeAssets/_withdrawAssets/_withdrawAmounts/_rateMode/_debtTokens are empty array, because when _flag is equal to 1, these parameters are useless.
        
4.  enter the `_opentrade` function: `_swapAddress.call(_swapParams)` is equivalent to calling `lendingPool.withdraw(weth, ATokenAmount, B)`, which burn A's AToken and returns weth to B.
    
5.  The lendingPool callback returns, then the flow returns to B.
    

Finally, bob gets 100e18 weth.

## Impact

Any MarginTrading contract that has AToken for a while will suffer funds loss.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check whether the _initiator of executeOperation is valid.
