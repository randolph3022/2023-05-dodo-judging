# MarginTradingFactory: Fee on transfer tokens will not behave as expected

## Summary

In MarginTradingFactory, it does not specifically restrict the type of ERC20 trade assets to be used

If fee on transfer token(s) is/are used, it will specifically cause inaccurate accounting report when transferring as the contract assumes that the ammount transferred is the amount recieved

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function _closetrade(
        uint8 _flag,
        address _swapAddress,
        address _swapApproveTarget,
        address[] memory _swapApproveToken,
        bytes memory _swapParams,
        address[] memory _tradeAssets,
        address[] memory _withdrawAssets,
        uint256[] memory _withdrawAmounts,
        uint256[] memory _rateMode,
        address[] memory _debtTokens
    ) internal {
        ***
                    IERC20(_tradeAssets[i]).transfer(_USER, _returnAmounts[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        emit ClosePosition(
            _flag,
            _swapAddress,
            _swapApproveToken,
            _tradeAssets,
            _tradeAmounts,
            _withdrawAssets,
            _withdrawAmounts,
            _rateMode,
            _returnAmounts
            );
    }
```

As seen above the contract emits an event assuming that the transferred amount is the amount received

## Impact

Inconsistent accounting
