# No whitelist for acceptable tokens

## Summary
Protocol expects to interact with `WETH USDC WBTC DAI MATIC` but there is no whitelist or checks in place.
## Vulnerability Detail
Protocol expects users to interact `WETH USDC WBTC DAI MATIC` but there is no whitelist or checks in place for acceptable token which means users could deposit any token into the lending pool and withdraw any tokens as well which could lead to issues if they protocol does not support such tokens.
## Impact
Unsupported tokens could be deposited and get stucked
