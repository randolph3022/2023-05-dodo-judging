# Low level call returns true if the address doesnâ€™t exist


## Summary

As written in the solidity documentation, the [low-level functions call, delegatecall and staticcall ](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions)return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed.

## Vulnerability Detail

The low-level functions `call` and `delegatecall` are used in some places in the code and in some instances it can be problematic. For example, in the \_safeTransferETH of the MarginTrading contract there is a low level call in order to send the ETH value, but if the given tokenAddress doesn't exist success will be equal to success and the function will return success and the code execution will be continued like the call was successful.
MarginTrading.\_safeTransferETH():

```solidity
    function _safeTransferETH(address to, uint256 value) internal {
        (bool success,) = to.call{value: value}(new bytes(0));
        require(success, "ETH_TRANSFER_FAILED");
    }
```

MarginTradingFactory.cleanETH():

```solidity
    function cleanETH(address _to, uint256 _amt) external onlyOwner {
        // @audit account existence should be checked before call
        (bool success,) = _to.call{value: _amt}(new bytes(0));
        require(success, "ETH_TRANSFER_FAILED");
        emit CleanETH(_to, _amt);
    }
```

## Impact

Improper executions of functions that use low level calls in a case when the called address does not exist or is an EOA, due to the lack of the conract existence check

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check before any low-level call that the address actually exists, for example before the low level call in the `_safeTransferETH` function you can check that the address is a contract by checking its code size.
