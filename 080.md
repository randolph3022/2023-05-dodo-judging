# MarginTrading.sol: When partially closing a trade all tokens are used to pay back debt and not only the swapped tokens

## Summary
It's expected by the protocol that funds can be in the `MarginTrading` contract without being used for anything.

We can see this by looking at the `MarginTradingFactory.depositMarginTradingETH` and `MarginTradingFactory.depositMarginTradingERC20` functions.

If the user sets `margin=false` as the parameter, the funds are only sent to the `MarginTrading` contract but NOT deposited into Aave.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTradingFactory.sol#L259-L272

The purpose of this is that the user can then call `lendingPoolDeposit` or `lendingPoolRepay` to add margin or close a trade.

When a trade is partially closed by taking out a flash loan and swapping it for the debt token all the funds are used to pay back debt but it should be restricted to the funds that were swapped.

## Vulnerability Detail
When partially closing a trade (`flag=0`) the `MarginTrading._closetrade` function is called and `_tradeAmounts` is set like this:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L320-L323

So it's set to the full balance, and this amount is then used to repay the debt:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L325-L327

So this does not leave those funds idle that were in the contract before.

## Impact
When partially closing a trade the amount that is repaid can be bigger than expected. So the funds that should remain in the contract for other purposes are used up and cannot be used otherwise.

Also since more debt is repaid than intended the trade is altered in an unintended way and will now be liquidated at a different price which is not what the user wants.

## Recommendation
Only use swapped funds to partially repay debt.
