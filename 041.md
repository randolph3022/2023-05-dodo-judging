# Missing Input Check Validation can cause unintended behaviour

## Summary

Missing input check validation can cause users to lose funds

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `MarginTradingFactory.sol`, the `createMargingTrading` function can be called with flag not equal to 1 or 2 as there's not input validation to ensure this: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTradingFactory.sol#L107-L119

This would lead to creating a marginContract Address with the zero address, and any ERC20 or ETH would be lost forever.

## Impact

Users can lose ERC20 or ETH forever.

## Recommendation
