# Users Are Forced To Give Maximum Allowance to Aave lendingPool

## Summary
In a scenario were Aave's `lendingPool` is hacked or compromised, margin trading users will be at a high risk of getting their funds rekt
## Vulnerability Detail

Here is the approval function:
```solidity
    function _approveToken(address _address, address _tokenAddress, uint256 _tokenAmount) internal {
        if (IERC20(_tokenAddress).allowance(address(this), _address) < _tokenAmount) {
            IERC20(_tokenAddress).approve(_address, type(uint256).max); //@audit-issue max approval
        }
    }

```
Requiring users to grant such extensive allowance to `Aave's` lending pool is not ideal, as the unpredictable nature of DeFi hacks leaves their funds vulnerable.
## Impact
In the event that the lending pool is compromised, an attacker could potentially exploit the unlimited approval granted by the `_approveToken` function to drain the entire balance of the user's margin trading contract

## Tool used

Manual Review and VS Code

## Recommendation
I recommend that the approval function `_approveToken` be updated to approve the lending pool to spend only the necessary amount, rather than using `type(uint256).max`, which allows the lending pool to spend any amount. Additionally, if the user's current allowance for the lending pool is not enough to cover the necessary amount, the allowance should be increased to the required level. This will reduce the risk of funds being drained from the user's account in the event that the lending pool is hacked.
