# Token approvals (and the further code) may revert sometimes

## Summary
The `approve` calls may revert sometimes.

## Vulnerability Detail
`MarginTrading` contains a few `approve` calls on arbitrary tokens. Some of them are results of a user-submitted data, but some are hardcoded.

However, some of ERC20 tokens (like `USDT`) may revert an approval attempt if there is non-zero allowance already set:

Thus, if the user, for instance, try to partially close a loan with the such weird token asset twice
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L330
then only the first try would be successful and the second one will revert.

## Impact
Partial DoS in some cases.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using your `_approveToken` approve wrapper since it approves max uint value just once and then does nothing if the allowance is still enough.
