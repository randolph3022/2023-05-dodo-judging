# Using the ERC20 approve() function makes the MarginTrading contract vulnerable to front-run attacks



## Summary

The ` approve()` function is implemented in multiple instances in the MarginTrading.sol contract, this same ` approve()` function has a known race condition that can lead to token theft. If a user calls the approve function a second time on a spender that was already allowed, the spender can front-run the transaction and call transferFrom() to transfer the previous value and still receive the authorization to transfer the new value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing functionality that allows a user to increase and decrease their allowance instead, as this will help prevent users losing funds from front-running attacks
