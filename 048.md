# It is not necessary to approve the lendingPool to spend the protocol's funds for the `MarginTrading._lendingPoolWithdraw()` function

## Summary
It is not necessary to approve the lendingPool to spend the protocol's funds for the `MarginTrading._lendingPoolWithdraw()` function, because the lending pool does not transfer funds from the protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `MarginTrading._lendingPoolWithdraw()` function performs a withdrawal of a specified amount of an asset from the lending pool to the contract's address. Before calling the `withdraw()` function of the lendingPool contract, the `_approveToken()` function is called to grant the lendingPool contract permission to spend the user's tokens.
However, it is not necessary to approve the lendingPool to spend the protocol's funds, because the lending pool does not transfer funds from the protocol.
```solidity
   function _lendingPoolWithdraw(address _asset, uint256 _amount, uint8 _flag) internal {
        _approveToken(address(lendingPool), _asset, _amount);
        lendingPool.withdraw(_asset, _amount, address(this));
        emit LendingPoolWithdraw(_asset, _amount, _flag);
    }
```
## Proof of Concept
1.Comment out the `_approveToken(address(lendingPool), _asset, _amount) `
2.Run the test code with 'forge test --match-path test/marginTrading/MarginTrading.t.sol --match-contract MarginTradingTest --match-test "testLendingPoolWithdraw"' still succeeds.
```solidity

## Impact
