# User's WETH funds are vulnerable to a griefing attack

## Summary
A user's WETH funds are vulnerable to a griefing attack where a victim user is paying flash loans fees for malicious flash loans. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's  suppose that we have 2 actors, Bob and Alice. Alice is a margin account user. 

1. Alice calls the function depositMarginTradingETH and decides not to use it as collateral. When margin is false, the function simple sends the WETH funds to the margin account where Alice can use the funds as collateral later.

2. Bob frontruns Alice and calls executeoperation in his own contract with Alice's margin account contract as the receiverAddress. Here he requests a WETH flash loan into Alice's margin contract

3. Alice's margin contract is now paying the flash loan fee for Bob's malicious WETH flash loan, resulting in an unexpected loss of funds for Alice 

## Impact

A user can lose funds by paying more in flash loans fees than anticipated due to greiving attacks from malicious actors
