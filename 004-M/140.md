# DODOApprove can steal users

## Summary

Users will need to approve DODOApprove to use the protocol. If DODOApprove turns malicious or is hacked, user assets can be stolen.

DODOApprove is not a contract in this protocol. As the auditing considers 3rd party contract and protocol owners `RESTRICT`ed , this risk should be taken into account. 

## Vulnerability Detail

MarginTradingFactory sets the DODOApprove address in constructor.

```solidity
    constructor(address _lendingPool, address _weth, address _DODOApprove, address _template) {
        LendingPool = _lendingPool;
        WETH = IWETH(_weth);
        MARGIN_TRADING_TEMPLATE = _template;
        DODOApprove = IDODOApprove(_DODOApprove);
    }
```

During deposit, DODOApprove.claimTokens is called to transfer tokens from user. This implies that user should first approve DODOApprove contract to use the protocol.

## Impact

A malicious or hacked DODOApprove can steal user asset.
