# `MarginTrading.withdrawERC20` may not receive the correct amount from `_lendingPoolWithdraw`

## Summary

The returned value from `lendingPool.withdraw` is the actual amount received from the aave lending pool. `MarginTrading.withdrawERC20` should use it as the amount when transferring back to the user.


## Vulnerability Detail

The user can withdraw ERC20 from the aave lending pool. But the received amount could be incorrect.

```solidity
    function withdrawERC20(
        address _marginAddress,
        uint256 _marginAmount,
        bool _margin,
        uint8 _flag
    ) external onlyUser {
        if (_margin) {
            _lendingPoolWithdraw(_marginAddress, _marginAmount, _flag);
        }
        IERC20(_marginAddress).transfer(msg.sender, _marginAmount);
        emit WithdrawERC20(_marginAddress, _marginAmount, _margin, _flag);
    }
```

The returned value from `lendingPool.withdraw` is the final amount withdrawn.
