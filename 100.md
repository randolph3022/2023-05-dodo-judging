# Funds stuck inside MarginTrading contract

## Summary

Funds (eth) can get stuck inside the MarginTrading contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The MarginTrading contract has a `receive` function which allows ether to be send to it.
However, there is no way to withdraw these ether again. So, any eth sent to the contract will get stuck.

Note: There is a function called `withdrawETH`, but it is only capable of withdrawing `WETH` tokens.

## Impact

Funds getting sent to the contract will be stuck inside.

## Recommendation

1. Do not specify a receive function if not needed.
2. Declare a `onlyUser` function withdraw native Eth.
