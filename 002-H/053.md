# `multicall()` in factory contract can be exploited to steal admin funds

## Summary

`delegatecall()` in for loop is susceptible to drain admin funds by reuse of `msg.value`

## Vulnerability Detail

`multicall()` is used to batch multiple txs and `delegatecall()`s to the same contract in a for loop. This pattern is vulnerable to reuse of the same `msg.value` because, inside a `delegatecall()`, `msg.sender` and `msg.value` are persisted.

Consider this scenario:

- assume there are some ETH in the factory contract, lets say 10 ETH. waiting for admin to withdraw using `cleanETH()`
- attacker can batch 10 `depositMarginTradingETH()` txs with `msg.value` = 1e18 using `multicall()`
- since the `msg.value` is persisted through all those calls 10 ETH is sent to the `lendingPool` on behalf of the attacker
- The attacker only sends 1 ETH and but receives 10 ETH.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1- Don't allow batching `delegatecalls` in a loop,
2- or remove any possibility of factory contract receiving ETH

a quote from `samczsun`

> using msg.value in complex systems is hard. It’s a global variable that you can’t change and persists across delegate calls. If you use msg.value to check that payment was received, you absolutely cannot place that logic in a loop.
