# USER FUNDS GET STUCK DURING WITHDRAWAL

## Summary
When the user specifies the parameter _margin to true during withdrawals, the pool does not send funds to the user.
## Vulnerability Detail
When depositing trading ETH into the `MarginTradingFactory`, we call the below function:
```solidity
   function depositMarginTradingETH(address _marginTradingAddress, bool _margin, uint8 _flag) public payable {
        require(IMarginTrading(_marginTradingAddress).user() == msg.sender, "factory:caller is not the user");
        WETH.deposit{value: msg.value}();
        WETH.transfer(_marginTradingAddress, msg.value);
        if (_margin) {
            IMarginTrading(_marginTradingAddress).lendingPoolDeposit(address(WETH), msg.value, _flag);
        }
        emit DepositMarginTradingETH(_marginTradingAddress, msg.value, _margin, _flag);
    }
  
``` 

 

There are two possible paths based on the value of `_margin`:
True: User -> MarginTradingAddress -> LendingPool
False: User -> MarginTradingAddress

When user wishes to withdraw ETH, we call the below function:
```solidity
    function withdrawERC20(
        address _marginAddress,
        uint256 _marginAmount,
        bool _margin,
        uint8 _flag
    ) external onlyUser {
        if (_margin) {
            _lendingPoolWithdraw(_marginAddress, _marginAmount, _flag);
        }
        IERC20(_marginAddress).transfer(msg.sender, _marginAmount);
        emit WithdrawERC20(_marginAddress, _marginAmount, _margin, _flag);
    }
``` 



There are two possible paths based on the value of `_margin`:
True: LendingPool -> MarginTradingAddress -> user
False: MarginTradingAddress -> user

Note that when we specify `True` for the _margin variable the flow is LendingPool -> MarginTradingAddress but no transfer to the user is done.
     
  

```solidity
if (_margin) {
            _lendingPoolWithdraw(address(WETH), _marginAmount, _flag);
        }

```  
## Impact
Users who specified their ETH/ERC20 as collateral cannot withdraw their funds.

Ensure there is a transfer of funds after withdrawing from lending pool
