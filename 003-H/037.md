# Eth present in the `MarginTrading` contract cannot be withdrawn.

## Summary
The already existing `withdrawETH` function will only work if the MarginTradingContract has some WETH. If you try to withdraw ETH, it will revert since the `WETH.withdraw` will revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
The below function cannot be used to withdrawETH from the MarginTrading Contract and it can only convert WETH to ETH and then transfer it to the owner/user.

```solidity
    function withdrawETH(bool _margin, uint256 _marginAmount, uint8 _flag) external payable onlyUser {
        if (_margin) {
            _lendingPoolWithdraw(address(WETH), _marginAmount, _flag);
        }
        WETH.withdraw(_marginAmount);
        _safeTransferETH(msg.sender, _marginAmount);
        emit WithdrawETH(_marginAmount, _margin, _flag);
    }
```

Here's a test to prove the above:-

```solidity
    function testWithdrawETHFromContract() public{
        address _marginTrading = createMarginTradingContract();
        vm.deal(_marginTrading, 100 ether);
        vm.expectRevert();
        IMarginTrading(_marginTrading).withdrawETH(false, 100 ether, 1);
    }
```

## Impact
Any ETH that resides in the MarginTrading contract cannot be withdrawn.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function withdrawETH(bool _margin, uint256 _marginAmount, uint8 _flag) external payable onlyUser {
        if (_margin) {
            _lendingPoolWithdraw(address(WETH), _marginAmount, _flag);
        }
        WETH.withdraw(_marginAmount);
        _safeTransferETH(msg.sender, _marginAmount);
        emit WithdrawETH(_marginAmount, _margin, _flag);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an additional argument for the function to check if the user wants to withdraw ETH or convert WETH to ETH and then withdraw. Or adding a separate function will also work.
