# _closetrade in MarginTrading.sol might not work in certain conditions

## Summary
_closetrade in MarginTrading.sol might not work in certain conditions - if one of the `_tradeAssets` is a token like USDC which has a blacklist and the user gets blacklisted. This will result in the function _closetrade reverting which opens up a lot of potential issues
## Vulnerability Detail
This is the _closetrade function:
```solidity
 function _closetrade(
        uint8 _flag,
        address _swapAddress,
        address _swapApproveTarget,
        address[] memory _swapApproveToken,
        bytes memory _swapParams,
        address[] memory _tradeAssets,
        address[] memory _withdrawAssets,
        uint256[] memory _withdrawAmounts,
        uint256[] memory _rateMode,
        address[] memory _debtTokens
    ) internal {
        if (_swapParams.length > 0) {
            // approve to swap route
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < _swapApproveToken.length; i++) {
                IERC20(_swapApproveToken[i]).approve(_swapApproveTarget, type(uint256).max);
            }

            (bool success,) = _swapAddress.call(_swapParams);
            require(success, "dodoswap fail");
        }
        uint256[] memory _tradeAmounts = new uint256[](_tradeAssets.length);
        if (_flag == 2) {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < _debtTokens.length; i++) {
                _tradeAmounts[i] = (IERC20(_debtTokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this)));
            }
        } else {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < _tradeAssets.length; i++) {
                _tradeAmounts[i] = (IERC20(_tradeAssets[i]).balanceOf(address(this)));
            }
        }
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _tradeAssets.length; i++) {
            _lendingPoolRepay(_tradeAssets[i], _tradeAmounts[i], _rateMode[i], 1);
        }
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _withdrawAssets.length; i++) {
            _lendingPoolWithdraw(_withdrawAssets[i], _withdrawAmounts[i], 1);
            IERC20(_withdrawAssets[i]).approve(address(lendingPool), _withdrawAmounts[i]);
        }
        uint256[] memory _returnAmounts = new uint256[](_tradeAssets.length);
        if (_flag == 2) {
            //Withdraw to user
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < _tradeAssets.length; i++) {
                _returnAmounts[i] = IERC20(_tradeAssets[i]).balanceOf(address(this));
                if (address(WETH) == _tradeAssets[i]) {
                    WETH.withdraw(_returnAmounts[i]);
                    _safeTransferETH(_USER, _returnAmounts[i]);
                } else {
    -->             IERC20(_tradeAssets[i]).transfer(_USER, _returnAmounts[i]);
                }
            }
        }
``` 
The line 
```solidity
 IERC20(_tradeAssets[i]).transfer(_USER, _returnAmounts[i]);
``` 
will revert if the _USER is blacklisted by USDC. Therefore, making closing the position impossible. 
This could result in severe consequences for the protocol depending on the rest of its existing implementation or added features in the future. 

For example, if the _closetrade function is used for closing trades due to liquidation, or just closing the trade in certain conditions, a user might open up a (high-leverage) trade, get himself blacklisted by USDC on purpose, and make the protocol not being able to close his position. 
## Impact
Depends on other functionality. It could lead to a DOS, trades that can't be liquidated, etc. 
In any case, a user should be able to close his trade in all conditions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Don't transfer the ERC20 tokens directly in the _closetrade function. Store them in the contract and let the user withdraw them on his own.
