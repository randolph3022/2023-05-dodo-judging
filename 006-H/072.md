# MarginTrading.sol: The whole balance and not just the traded funds are deposited into Aave when a trade is opened

## Summary
It's expected by the protocol that funds can be in the `MarginTrading` contract without being deposited into Aave as margin.

We can see this by looking at the `MarginTradingFactory.depositMarginTradingETH` and `MarginTradingFactory.depositMarginTradingERC20` functions.

If the user sets `margin=false` as the parameter, the funds are only sent to the `MarginTrading` contract but NOT deposited into Aave.

So clearly there is the expectation for funds to be in the `MarginTrading` contract that should not be deposited into Aave.

This becomes an issue when a trade is opened.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's look at the `MarginTrading._openTrade` function that is called when a trade is opened:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L257-L279

The whole balance of the token will be deposited into Aave:

```solidity
_tradeAmounts[i] = IERC20(_tradeAssets[i]).balanceOf(address(this)); 
_lendingPoolDeposit(_tradeAssets[i], _tradeAmounts[i], 1); 
```

Not just those funds that have been acquired by the swap. This means that funds that should stay in the `MarginTrading` contract might also be deposited as margin.

## Impact
When opening a trade funds can be deposited into Aave unintentionally. Thereby the funds act as margin and the trade can incur a larger loss than expected.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is necessary to differentiate the funds that are acquired by the swap and those funds that were there before and should stay in the contract:

     }
```

If funds that were in the contract prior to the swap should be deposited there is the separate `MarginTrading.lendingPoolDeposit` function to achieve this.
