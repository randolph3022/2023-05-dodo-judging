# MarginTradingFactory.sol: funds are not deposited to lending pool which means positions cannot be opened when MarginTrading contract is created

## Summary
The `MarginTradingFactory` contract allows to create `MarginTrading` contracts via the `createMarginTrading` function.

The functionality to immediately open a trade is broken since the deposited funds are not actually deposited into the lending pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the user creates a `MarginTrading` contract he can specify `executeParams` which allows the user to execute flash loans and therefore to open a trading position.

In order for this to work the user must also specify `depositParams` and deposit funds as margin:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTradingFactory.sol#L138-L150

We can see that the second to last parameter in both deposit calls above is `false` which means that the funds are not actually deposited into the lending pool but just sent to the `MarginTrading` contract:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTradingFactory.sol#L203-L211

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTradingFactory.sol#L259-L272

So there is not actually a margin deposited into the lending pool and the flash loan to open a position will fail.

## Impact
The functionality of the `MarginTradingFactory` contract is broken. It's not possible to immediately open a position when the `MarginTrading` contract is created.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set the two parameters I mentioned above to `true` such that the funds are actually deposited to the lending pool and used as margin.
