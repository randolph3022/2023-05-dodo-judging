# Margin accounts wont be able to claim reward tokens of AAVE's ACTIVE liquidity mining program

## Summary
Margin accounts wont be able to claim reward tokens of AAVE's ACTIVE liquidity mining program

## Vulnerability Detail
Aave incentives its users through its liquidity mining program.
[check here for more details](https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/guides/liquidity-mining#claimrewards) 

The program is currently active, check the following contract interactions for verification
[Mainnet: Aave Incentive Controller](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd784927Ff2f95ba542BfC824c8a8a98F3495f6b5#readProxyContract)
[Polygon: Aave Incentive Controller](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x357D51124f59836DeD84c8a1730D72B749d8BC23/contracts)
 
To claim these reward tokens, the user needs to call `claimRewards()` on the respective contract per chain.
**However, the current margin account implementation does not expose any way for the user to do so, wasting these rewards tokens.**
Depending on the size of user actions, this could lead to a loss of a significant amount.

## Impact
Loss of reward tokens of AAVE's liquidity mining program
