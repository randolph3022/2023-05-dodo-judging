# MISSING CONTRACT CHECK

## Summary
`_safeTransferETH` function in the MarginTrading contract performs a direct ETH transfer without verifying the user is a smart contract or an EOA
## Vulnerability Detail
 If the user happens to be a smart contract and we do a direct transfer eg: to.call{value: 2 ether}(), and the smart contract does not have a payable fallback or a receive function the transfer will always fail

## Impact
Transfer of ether will fail if the user is a smart contract without a payable fallback or receive function
