# withdrawal from AAVE requires the approval of AToken

## Summary

The function `_lendingPoolWithdraw` in the `MarginTrading` contract is responsible for withdrawing funds from the Aave lending pool. However, it does not include the required approval step for the corresponding `aToken` transfer, which means that the function call will revert and the withdrawal will not be executed.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue occurs in the `_lendingPoolWithdraw` function highlighted in the code below : 

```solidity
function _lendingPoolWithdraw(address _asset, uint256 _amount, uint8 _flag) internal {
    _approveToken(address(lendingPool), _asset, _amount);
    lendingPool.withdraw(_asset, _amount, address(this));
    emit LendingPoolWithdraw(_asset, _amount, _flag);
}
```

As you can see the function approves the lending pool for the `_asset` token transfer but it is supposed to approve for the `atoken` token correspanding to the `_asset` token instead (for example aDAI when ERC20 token is DAI), this means that when calling the `lendingPool.withdraw` function the lending pool will not be able to transfer/burn the `atoken` from the `MarginTrading` contract as it has not been approved (allowed) to do so and the function call will revert.

The function `_lendingPoolWithdraw` is used for all the withdrawals operations from the Aave protocol so the user will no be able to get his deposited funds back.

## Impact

The impact of this issue is that the `_lendingPoolWithdraw` function will fail to execute, preventing the user from withdrawing funds from the Aave lending pool. This can result in financial losses, as the user will not be able to access their deposited funds.

## Recommendation

To address this issue, the `_lendingPoolWithdraw` function should include an approval step for the corresponding `aToken` transfer before calling the `lendingPool.withdraw` function.
