# Use safeIncreaseAllowance() rather than approve()

## Summary
Similiar issue to using .transfer(), some tokens dont adhere to EIP20 and may return false instead of reverting upon failure to set an allowance. 
## Vulnerability Detail
code execution will continue even if for some reason approval is not succession and the token returns false instead of reverting. 
## Impact
code execution will continue even if for some reason approval is not succession and the token returns false instead of reverting.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use safeErc20.safeIncreaseAllowances() rather than .approve. additionally, unless for some specific reason infinite approval must be used, increase allowance by amount, rather than type(uint).max.
