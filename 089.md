## Summary
Use safeTransfer instead of transfer. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Several functions in the protocol uses transfer function to send erc20 token but all of the token have implemented the erc20 standard for example usdt.

## Impact
An impact could be that tokens get stuck in the margin contract which the user cant get hold on.
