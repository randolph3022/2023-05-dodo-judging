# Use `safeTransfer` consistently instead of `transfer`

## Summary
Use `safeTransfer()` consistently instead of `transfer()` for ERC20 tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

Not all ERC20 tokens revert on failed transfers:

For ensuring successful transfer of such tokens `safeTransfer()` should be used instead of `transfer()`.

## Impact
Failed transfer of tokens could lead to stuck tokens on contract balance.
