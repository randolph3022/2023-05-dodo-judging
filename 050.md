# Use safeTransfer() instead of transfer() when sending ERC20 tokens

## Summary

The `ERC20.transfer()` method will return a boolean which results in a success or failure of the transaction. The returning value will need to be validated as there are some tokens which do not revert on failure.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are some tokens which exist but don’t comply with the ERC20 standard. In the `MarginTrading` contract, it’s assumed that only `WETH USDC WBTC DAI MATIC` are accepted however, there is no whitelisting or validation that only these tokens are to be accepted which may indicate to the user that a token like USDT (which is supported by Aave) is able to be used. Such tokens don’t correctly implement the latest ERC20 standard and as a result, calling them with the expected function signatures will result in a revert. 

## Impact

Tokens which don’t conform to the ERC20 standard will return `false` and continue code execution.

## Recommendation

I recommend using OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20 for `safeTransfer` functionality to provide an extra layer of security by appropriately handling the return value.
