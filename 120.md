# ALLOWED_FLASH_LOAN can drain accounts

## Summary

Flash loan proxy is able to steal funds

## Vulnerability Detail

As stated in the contest page, ALLOWED_FLASH_LOAN mapping is used to allow third party accounts to open and close positions on the user account.

> There is a proxy role that has permissions stored in the ALLOWED_FLASH_LOAN structure. This role can execute opening or closing positions on behalf of the user to achieve stop loss or take profit objectives.

However giving this addresses the right to open/close positions with arbitrary params, makes them eligible to perform any action on the account. This role is able to do much more than they should, even steal funds in the account. 

Consider this case:

Malicious flash loan proxy calls `executeFlashLoans()` on a MarginTrade account with some USDC, with following params:
- flag = 1, for `_opentrade`
- `_swapAddress` = USDC contract address
- `_swapParams` = `transfer(attackerAddress, contractBalance)`
- `_swapApproveToken` = []
- `_tradeAssets` = []

by doing so, instead of performing a swap and opening a lending position, `executeOperation` callback from aave transfers all the USDCs from contract to the attackerAddress


## Impact

All funds can be stolen by the proxy account, high impact.
