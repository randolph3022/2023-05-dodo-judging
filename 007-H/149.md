# Lack of consideration when liquidation happens, there is no check about the collateral ratio when doing lend token withdraw

## Summary

Lack of consideration when liquidation happens, there is no check about the collateral ratio when doing lend token withdraw 

## Vulnerability Detail

Lack of consideration when liquidation happens, there is no check about the collateral ratio when doing lend token withdraw 

```solidity
    /// @notice Withdraws the token from the lending pool
    /// @dev Token authorization, then withdraw from lendingPool.
    /// @param _asset Asset token address
    /// @param _amount Asset token Amount
    /// @param _flag Operation flag
    function _lendingPoolWithdraw(address _asset, uint256 _amount, uint8 _flag) internal {
        _approveToken(address(lendingPool), _asset, _amount);
        lendingPool.withdraw(_asset, _amount, address(this));
        emit LendingPoolWithdraw(_asset, _amount, _flag);
    }
```

> Introduction
A liquidation is a process that occurs when a borrower's health factor goes below 1 due to their collateral value not properly covering their loan/debt value. This might happen when the collateral decreases in value or the borrowed debt increases in value against each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor.
In a liquidation, up to 50% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available, so after a liquidation that amount liquidated from your debt is repaid.

> How much is the liquidation penalty?
> The liquidation penalty (or bonus for liquidators) depends on the asset used as collateral. You can find every assets' liquidation fee in the risk parameters section.

## Impact

if the collateral ratio is close to liquidation and user withdraw and close then the liuqidation happens unexpected and user can lose a lot of more money then he expected!
