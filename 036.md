# Attacker can drain all funds in the wallet using a flashloan

## Summary

Loan `_initiator` is not checked in `executeOperation()` and can be exploited to steal all funds in the contract

## Vulnerability Detail

`executeOperation()` is called by the lending pool and it is gated by `onlyLendingPool` modifier. However, anyone can request a flash loan from lending pool with any contract as receiver and exploit this function to steal all funds in the contract.

An attacker can request a flash loan on victims address and set swap params to make a callback to his own contract and steal all the funds in the victims contract. Since there is no check for `_initiator` in `executeOperation()`, there is no effective access control.


## Impact

Critical Impact, all funds in all contracts can easily be stolen.
