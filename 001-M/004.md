# Hardcoding 0 for referral code could result in a loss of funds if Aave re-starts their referral program

## Summary
The protocol calls various functions from Aave which has a parameter for a referral code. This is to reward 3rd party integrators. The protocols hardcodes this parameter to be 0, as the program has been halted. However, the Aave DAO can vote to re-start the program
