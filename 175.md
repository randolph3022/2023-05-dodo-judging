# An attacker can  reenter with `multicall->depositMarginTradingETH` and cause loss of funds

## Summary
Since an multi-call uses a delegate call and msg.value is the same for all calls since the first one an attacker can reenter and steal funds
## Vulnerability Detail
let's say the attacker deposits 5 eth in multi call and then the user calls it again in `mulitcall` then it's the same msg.value and we can inflate our weth balance and steal funds 
## Impact
loss of funds 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function multicall(bytes[] calldata data) public payable returns (bytes[] memory results) {
        results = new bytes[](data.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(data[i]);


```
