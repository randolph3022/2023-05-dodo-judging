# Giving infinite approvals is dangerous

## Summary
In the MarginTrading contract, .approve is always used with giving the maximum amount of allowance - `type(uint256).max`.
This could result in users losing their money if a certain contract that they gave approvals to becomes compromised.
## Vulnerability Detail
[This has happened in the past](https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1644907207530774530) and a lot of people lost a lot of money while the issue is easily preventable.

Let's take a look at the `_approveToken` function for example:
```solidity
function _approveToken(address _address, address _tokenAddress, uint256 _tokenAmount) internal {
        if (IERC20(_tokenAddress).allowance(address(this), _address) < _tokenAmount) {
            IERC20(_tokenAddress).approve(_address, type(uint256).max);
        }
    }
``` 
which is used in the `_lendingPoolWithdraw`, `_lendingPoolDeposit`, and `_lendingPoolRepay` functions. Also, infinite approvals are given in the `_closetrade` and `_opentrade` functions. I'm pasting links to the code in the code snippet section.

The result is that at a certain point in time, the user might find himself in a situation where he gave infinite approvals for a lot of different assets to a couple of smart contracts which in the event they get exploited, he'll lose his money.

Again, this has happened in the past and it is a valid concern. There is absolutely no reason to take the risk of users losing funds because they gave unlimited allowance to be able to use your protocol.

Especially, when the issue is easily fixable. 
## Impact
Users are forced to give unlimited approvals if they want to use your protocol. 

This exposes them to the risk of other smart contracts getting exploited and their funds being stolen via using MarginTrading.sol

Also, this issue could become known and users might be hesitant to interact with protocols that give infinite approvals for their funds to arbitrary smart contracts which are supposed to be "trusted".

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Just approve the required `amount`, not `type(uint256).max`.
