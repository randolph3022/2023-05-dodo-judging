# Transaction will revert when using USDT tokens (or other non-compliant ERC20 tokens)

## Summary
Transaction will revert when using USDT tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
USDT token has a non-standard `approve` function implementation, as it doesn't return a boolean. So, normal `IERC20` interface will cause the EVM to expect a boolean as a return value but it won't get any when `token` is USDT, and so the tx will revert.

## Impact
Any contract functionality that utilizes `_approveToken` will cause tx revert when the token is USDT.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Use `safeApprove` from OpenZeppelin's standard `SafeERC20.sol` and approve first to 0 for tokens like USDT.
