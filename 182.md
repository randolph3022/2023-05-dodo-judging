# `MarginTrading.sol` has unnecessary approve

## Summary

`MarginTrading.sol` has unnecessary approve

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: MarginTrading.sol
363     function _lendingPoolWithdraw(address _asset, uint256 _amount, uint8 _flag) internal {
364 >>      _approveToken(address(lendingPool), _asset, _amount);
365         lendingPool.withdraw(_asset, _amount, address(this));
366         emit LendingPoolWithdraw(_asset, _amount, _flag);
367     }
```

```solidity
File: MarginTrading.sol
328         for (uint256 i = 0; i < _withdrawAssets.length; i++) {
329             _lendingPoolWithdraw(_withdrawAssets[i], _withdrawAmounts[i], 1);
330 >>          IERC20(_withdrawAssets[i]).approve(address(lendingPool), _withdrawAmounts[i]);
331         }
```

Withdraw does not need to approve to the lendingPool, and redundant approve operations are done here.
