# An attacker might be able to to greif users on variable rate and causing dos

## Summary
If a user picks a variable-rate loan, an attacker can front-run you and borrow more funds causing the variable rate to go up.
## Vulnerability Detail
since the user picks a variable rate loan and let's say the asset is `Matic` which has 9 million dollars of available liquidity
so an attacker can flash loan that 8.7 million liquidity with 5  million of collateral, causing the borrowing rate to increase since there is no liquidity left.
Then the user makes a transaction of 100_000 Matic with a variable rate loan so since the variable rate increases the debt will be 
significantly higher than the collateral available and then the user's tx is likely to revert since the user doesn't have the funds to repay such high rates.
## Impact
loss of funds/dos
## Code Snippet
here the debt of the user 
```solidity
//updated total debt plus high variable rate 
      _tradeAmounts[i] = (IERC20(_debtTokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this)))
```
```solidity
// we try to repay the loan but we don't have enough funds even if we set up collateral at a good ltv ratio if the rate is 50 percent //then it will revert
_lendingPoolRepay(_tradeAssets[i], _tradeAmounts[i], _rateMode[i], 1);
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
have some sort of slippage protection in this function and if a check if the variable rate goes crazy just revert. instead of making the user take on hugh amount of debt
