# `MarginTrading.executeOperation` misses the flashloan initiator check so anyone can get access to user's funds

## Summary
`MarginTrading.executeOperation` function misses the flashloan initiator check.

## Vulnerability Detail
There's the AAVE callback function `MarginTrading.executeOperation` that should be, by-design, executed by the AAVE LP after a flashloan is taken in `MarginTrading.executeFlashLoans`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L106
with the `params` argument passed through.

This function then performs a variety of operations (by calling either `_opentrade` or `_closetrade`) encoded inside this `params` argument like approving custom tokens, arbitrary external calls and so on:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L270

However, what's missed here is to check who was the initiator of this flashloan.

An attacker can first send a bit of some tokens to the victim's `MarginTrading` contract (for instance, `1 USDT`) to cover the AAVE flashloan premium in future. Then he can call the [AAVE LendingPool.flashloan](https://docs.aave.com/developers/core-contracts/pool#flashloan) by his own, passing the victim's `MarginTrading` address as the `receiverAddress`. Also, he will pass the malicious `params` on this call. For instance, the loaned amount will be `0.1 USDT`.

Then the AAVE will send flashloaned funds to this `MarginTrading` contract address and call its `executeOperation` callback passing the `params` to it. The `MarginTrading`, in turn, will execute arbitrary code encoded within the `params` received.

And, after that, the flashloan will be successfully repaid with the funds initially sent by attacker.

## Impact
The attacker can get access to victim's `MarginTrading` tokens, ether and lending pool funds also.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider checking that the flashloan initiator is the `MarginTrading` contract itself:
```solidity
function executeOperation(
        address[] calldata _assets,
        uint256[] calldata _amounts,
        uint256[] calldata _premiums,
        address _initiator,
        bytes calldata _params
    ) external override onlyLendingPool returns (bool) {
        require(_initiator == address(this), "flashloan initiator is not MarginTrading");
```
