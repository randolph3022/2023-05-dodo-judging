# Owner of the factory should be able to take fund when isAllowedProxy set is on

## Summary

Owner of the factory should be able to take fund when isAllowedProxy set is on

## Vulnerability Detail

In MarginTrading.sol

```solidity
    modifier onlyFlashLoan() {
        require(
            _USER == msg.sender || owner() == msg.sender
                || IMarginTradingFactory(owner()).isAllowedProxy(address(this), msg.sender),
            "caller is unauthorized"
        );
        _;
    }

```

Per contest onchain context:

> Q: Are there any additional protocol roles? If yes, please explain in detail:
There is a proxy role that has permissions stored in the ALLOWED_FLASH_LOAN structure. This role can execute opening or closing positions on behalf of the user to achieve stop loss or take profit objectives.

and the admin protocol is label as trusted

when the ALLOWED_FLASH_LOAN, this role can execute opening or closing position but should be able to steal fund

We are calling

```solidity
    function executeFlashLoans(
        address[] calldata assets,
        uint256[] calldata amounts,
        uint256[] calldata modes,
        address mainToken,
        bytes calldata params
    ) external onlyFlashLoan {
        address receiverAddress = address(this);

        // the various assets to be flashed

        // the amount to be flashed for each asset

        // 0 = no debt, 1 = stable, 2 = variable

        address onBehalfOf = address(this);
        // bytes memory params = "";
        lendingPool.flashLoan(receiverAddress, assets, amounts, modes, onBehalfOf, params, Types.REFERRAL_CODE);
        emit FlashLoans(assets, amounts, modes, mainToken);
    }
```

and the callback executeOpereation executes

```solidity
  function executeOperation(
        address[] calldata _assets,
        uint256[] calldata _amounts,
        uint256[] calldata _premiums,
        address _initiator,
        bytes calldata _params
    ) external override onlyLendingPool returns (bool) {
```

we opening or close trade, 

```solidity
    function _opentrade(
        address _swapAddress,
        address _swapApproveTarget,
        address[] memory _swapApproveToken,
        bytes memory _swapParams,
        address[] memory _tradeAssets
    ) internal {
        if (_swapParams.length > 0) {
            // approve to swap route
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < _swapApproveToken.length; i++) {
                IERC20(_swapApproveToken[i]).approve(_swapApproveTarget, type(uint256).max);
            }

            (bool success,) = _swapAddress.call(_swapParams);
            require(success, "dodoswap fail");
        }
```

a max approval is given to the approval target + a low level call is called

both are dangouers,

the owner of the factory can just set a malicious contract and give max allowance and then use that contract to transfer the fund in the margin trading contract later 

or set swapAddress to a ERC20 token 

and encode the data

```solidity
abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transferFrom, address(victim), address(hacker), amount)
```

or

```solidity
abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transfer, address(hacker), amount)
```

to steal fund easily

## Impact

Owner of the factory should be able to take fund when isAllowedProxy set is on

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol do not give max allowance and do not do this kind of low level call
