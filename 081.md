# Missing precision scaling cause miscalculation of funds

## Summary
The `MarginTrading.sol` contract doesn't handle decimal precisions. This may cause calculation issues if 2 tokens of varying decimal points are used. For example USDC has 6 decimals and DAI has 18 decimals. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L275, 
`_tradeAmounts[i] = IERC20(_tradeAssets[i]).balanceOf(address(this));`, 
the balance may be greater than what it should be, as the decimal precision was not handled. 
This may cause issues like depositing or withdrawing more
