# MarginTrading template deployed without initialize

## Summary

MarginTrading is deployed as proxy implementation contract and is OwnableUpgradeable.

## Vulnerability Detail

It is not initialized after deployment.

We can see it in the deployment scripts.

And we can find that the contract deployed on the goerli testnet has zero owner address.

## Impact

Attacker can initialize the template contract and upgrade it to a malicious one to steal funds.

This one may be out of the scope of auditing. But the demanage will be huge so I decided to mention it.
