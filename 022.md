# In case if user provided msg.value to createMarginTrading function while depositing tokens, then his eth is lost in the factory

## Summary
In case if user provided msg.value to createMarginTrading function while depositing tokens, then his eth is lost in the factory
## Vulnerability Detail
`MarginTradingFactory.createMarginTrading` allows user to create `MarginTrading` contract and then [top up it](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTradingFactory.sol#L138-L150) with tokens or with eth.

The problem is that in case if user will provide `msg.value != 0` to the function and provide `_depositFlag == 1`, that means that `_depositMarginTradingERC20` function will be called which will transfer `_depositAmount` of tokens.
In this case `msg.value` amount will be lost for user.

This can happen, by user's mistake.
## Impact
User can loose eth provided with the call when depositing erc20 tokens.

## Recommendation
Check that in case of erc20 top up, msg.value is 0.
