# Missing logic for `debtTokens`

## Summary

Missing logic for `_debtTokens` in `_closeTrade` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `_closeTrade` is used to carry out some repayments and withdrawals on the lending pool. Based on the value of the `_flag` argument passed to it, it splits off its code path in two.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L316-L324

Here we see that for `_flag` = 2, the `_tradeAmounts` is determined from the `_debtTokens` array. Otherwise, the `tradeAmounts` is determined from the `_tradeAssets` array.

In the subsequent lines, the repayment takes place irrespective of the value of `_flag` passed.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L325-L327

This means that if `_flag` = 2, the repayment is carried out on the `_tradeAssets` array, but the repayment amount is determined from the `_debtTokens` array. If these two arrays are not the exact same, this can cause a lot of issues, and this assumption is not asserted everywhere. If these two arrays differ in length, the function will revert due to unequal array lengths, and if the items in both these arrays are not the same, then it will use wrong amounts.

Also, there is no functionality for `_debtTokens` anywhere else in the code, making it a useless variable.

The issue can be either of the following:

1. `_debtTokens` is an unnecessary variable. Can be replaced with `_tradeAssets` everywhere, since it HAS to be the same.
2. There is a bug in the repayment function, and the repayment function should also switch between `_debtTokens` and `_tradeAssets` based on the `_flag` value.

## Impact

For case 1, the impact is low, since the variable is useless, and can be removed. For case 2, the impact is high since the wrong variables are being used.

## Recommendation

Change the repayment function to use the correct variables based on the `_flag` value.
