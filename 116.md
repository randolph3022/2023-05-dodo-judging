# Incorrect flags are passed for deposit actions of `createMarginTrading`

## Summary
Incorrect flags are passed for deposit actions of `createMarginTrading` 

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTradingFactory.sol#L138-L150
It's unclear what the flag means in the context of `_depositMarginTradingERC20` and `depositMarginTradingETH`, however as we can see above, the same flag is being passed: **1.**

If we consider some combinations of what flag could be 
_(doing this, since the protocol lead didn't respond to the friend request, hence no clarification)_

**Variant A:**
If the flag passed represents `_depositFlag` then it should be 1 in the case of `depositMarginTradingERC20`, and 2 in the case of `depositMarginTradingETH`.

**Variant B:**
If the flag passed represents account type, cross or isolated, then it should be passed as 1 or 2 in both cases depending on account type and not hardcoded to 1.

As you can see, the current code doesn't satisfy any of the above possibilities.
:red_circle:  **It is wrong no matter what definition of flag you consider** :red_circle: 

## Impact
There is no material impact, but off-chain indexers using this and expecting either variant A or variant B to be true would be compromised.
