# USER CANNOT INCREASE MARGIN

## Summary
The `DODOApprove.claimTokens()` function is used to transfer token from user to the margin trading contract. However, since the MarginTradingFactory is not explicitly set as a DODO Proxy, tokens cannot be transferred.

## Vulnerability Detail
The docs state that: 

> Increasing margin involves depositing funds into Aave through DODOApprove and DODOApproveProxy, which are authorized for transfer in the MarginTradingFactory contract.

The mentioned transfer happens in `_depositMarginTradingERC20` function. This function claims the user tokens and transfers them to the MarginTrading contract where the flashloan transfers happen. To claim the tokens, it calls `DODOApprove.claimTokens`. 

The problem lies in the `DODOApprove.claimTokens` check as shown on: [0x6D310348d5c12009854DFCf72e0DF9027e8cb4f4 ](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x6D310348d5c12009854DFCf72e0DF9027e8cb4f4#code)

```solidity
require(msg.sender) == _DODO_PROXY_, "DODOApprove:Access restricted");
``` 
Since the MarginTradingFactory is not a DODO Proxy, the call `DODOApprove.claimTokens` will revert.

## Impact
user cannot deposit tokens to increase their margin.
