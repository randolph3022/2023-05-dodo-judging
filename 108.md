# Tokens can be lost if user is blacklisted

## Summary

Some tokens like `USDC` have a contract level admin controlled address blacklist. If an address is blacklisted, then transfers to and from that address are forbidden.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `MarginTradingFactory` when owner calls `cleanToken()` to send `USDC` tokens to user address `_to` tokens will not be transferred and become stuck if the address `_to` is blacklisted by `USDC`.

## Impact

Stuck funds.
