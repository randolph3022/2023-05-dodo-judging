# `MarginTrading.sol` can't be upgradable.

## Summary

`MarginTradingFactory` uses `Clones.cloneDeterministic` to create a new `MarginTrading` contract. However, `MarginTrading` seems to be an upgradeable contract.  But `Clone` is not compatible with upgradeable contracts. 

https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/proxy
> The Clones library provides a way to deploy minimal non-upgradeable proxies for cheap. This can be useful for applications that require deploying many instances of the same contract (for example one per user, or one per task). These instances are designed to be both cheap to deploy, and cheap to call. The drawback being that they are not upgradeable.

## Vulnerability Detail

`MarginTradingFactory` uses `Clones.cloneDeterministic` to create a new `MarginTrading`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTradingFactory.sol#L121
```solidity
    function createMarginTrading(
        uint8 _flag,
        bytes calldata depositParams,
        bytes calldata executeParams
    ) external payable returns (address marginTrading) {
        if (_flag == 1) {
            marginTrading = Clones.cloneDeterministic(
                MARGIN_TRADING_TEMPLATE,
                keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, crossMarginTrading[msg.sender].length, _flag))
            );
            …
    }
```

And `MarginTrading` seems to be an upgradeable contract.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L19
```solidity
contract MarginTrading is OwnableUpgradeable, IMarginTrading, IFlashLoanReceiver {
```


The answer in this post explains why `Clone` is not compatible with upgradeable contracts. https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/contract-factory-for-upgradeable-erc721/11153
> The problem is that the implementation address for the transparent proxy is kept in the storage of the transparent proxy, but when the user goes through the clone it will be using the storage of the clone, so it doesn’t know where to delegate.



## Impact

If MARGIN_TRADING_TEMPLATE is an upgradeable contract, `Clones.cloneDeterministic` only returns the address of the transparent proxy without the actual implementation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Don’t use an upgradeable contract as the implement address in `Clone`. If DODO want a upgradeability mechanism for `MarginTrading`, consider using [Beacon](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/proxy#beacon)
