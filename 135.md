# No slippage protection when swapping in `MarginTrading`

## Summary

When performing an ERC20 swap the `_opentrade` and `_closetrade` functions in the `MarginTrading` contract do not implement slippage protection, so the user can potentially lose funds when calling those functions in the case of a high slippage.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue occurs in both `_opentrade` and `_closetrade` functions as they both use the same logic to perform a swap, this is highlighted in the code below : 

```solidity
if (_swapParams.length > 0) {
    // approve to swap route
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _swapApproveToken.length; i++) {
        IERC20(_swapApproveToken[i]).approve(_swapApproveTarget, type(uint256).max);
    }

    (bool success,) = _swapAddress.call(_swapParams);
    require(success, "dodoswap fail");
}
```

As you can see the swap logic implemented in the two function does not contain any check on the received amount after the swap and both functions uses directly `IERC20.balanceOf(address(this))` to get the received amount and execute the call, and it's also worth noting that the `_swapParams` argument passed in the swap call contains only the following parameters : tokenFrom, tokenTo and amountFrom and does not have any way to ensure slippage protection, this can be seen in the test files (Context.t.sol) :

```solidity
function getSwapCalldata(
    address fromToken,
    address toToken,
    uint256 fromAmount
) public pure returns (bytes memory swapParams) {
    swapParams = abi.encodeWithSignature("swap(address,address,uint256)", fromToken, toToken, fromAmount);
}
```

So in the end there is no way to see if the amount received by the contract after the swap correspand to the one expected by the user and thus in the case of high slippage the user will lose funds.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend to add a slippage protection in the both `_opentrade` and `_closetrade` functions, this can be done by adding a `minReceive` argument in the two functions and checking if the returned ERC20 amount is above it or not meaning `IERC20.balanceOf(address(this)) >= minReceive`.
