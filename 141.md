# Use safeTransfer instead of transfer for ERC20 tokens

## Summary
Use `safeTransfer` instead of `transfer` for ERC20 tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
The `transfer` function returns a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

## Impact
Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer and hence token transfers could fail silently without reverting.

## Code Snippet
In [`marginTrading`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L19) contract, lines 212 and 341
