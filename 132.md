# The usage of Aave V2  can result in  DOS of the entire functionality because of the thin liqudity

## Summary
The protocol margin functionality can be dos by an attack because the liquidity on Aave V2 is very thin, the developers have missed this because they have only tested with local mocks where they have mocked all the liqudity.
## Vulnerability Detail
The sponsor have made it clear in the discord channel they will only use Aave V2 in the beginning, this will be very problematic on the main networks because the V2 is very thin on liquidity as most of it have migrated to V3, about 11k total on [polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8dff5e27ea6b7ac08ebfdf9eb090f32ee9a30fcf) and 46k total on [ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7d2768de32b0b80b7a3454c06bdac94a69ddc7a9)  and all of this liquidity is spread between multiple tokens, in the case of DAI, there  is only 6k$ worth of DAI inside the pool on polygon. The economic threshold for an attacker to acaparate all the liquidity, even for just one block is extremely small, this way an attacker could dos any margin transaction because there will be no liquidity left for that margin transaction.

## Impact
Any user can be dos by an attacker, or the whole protocol could be dos by an attacker because the economic threshold to take all the liquidity or most of it from Aave V2 is extremely small.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Switch completely from Aave V2 to Aave V3 where is all the liqudity.
