# Flashloan proxy can steal assets

## Summary

Flashloan proxy should only be able to open/close trade on behalf of the user. But a malicious proxy can steal assets leveraging the swap functions.

## Vulnerability Detail

`executeFlashLoans` is protected by onlyFlashLoan so it can be called by the proxy set by user.

```solidity
    modifier onlyFlashLoan() {
        require(
            _USER == msg.sender || owner() == msg.sender
                || IMarginTradingFactory(owner()).isAllowedProxy(address(this), msg.sender),
            "caller is unauthorized"
        );
        _;
    }

    function executeFlashLoans(
        address[] calldata assets,
        uint256[] calldata amounts,
        uint256[] calldata modes,
        address mainToken,
        bytes calldata params
    ) external onlyFlashLoan {
```

In `_opentrade`, tokens are approved to _swapApproveTarget. Then _swapAddress is called to use the tokens.

All the variables are decoded from executeFlashLoans `params` and controlled by the proxy. The proxy can set _swapApproveTarget and _swapAddress to his contracts and steal the tokens.

He can also do the same thing in _closetrade.

## Impact

Flashloan proxy can steal assets.
