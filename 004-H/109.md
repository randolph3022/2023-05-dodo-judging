# Everyone can use lendingPool to call `executeOperation` and steal all ERC20 tokens.

## Summary

A griefing attack in MarginTrading contract. Everyone can use lendingPool to call `executeOperation` and steal all ERC20 tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/92391/explain-griefing-attack-on-aave-flash-loan

`executeOperation()` is `onlyLendingPool`, but any other users can use the lendingPool to call `executeOperation()` of the `_USER`'s MarginTrading contract.

## Impact

Attacker can steal all tokens in the `_USER`'s MarginTrading contract by `_opentrade()`, flag is 1 in `executeOperation()`, because attacker can [approve any token to any address](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L266-L268).

Also, the attacker can [call any contracts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L270), for example, `lendingPool.withdraw()` to withdraw tokens from the lending pool.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check `executeOperation()` should be called after `executeFlashLoans()`.

```diff
    function executeFlashLoans(
        address[] calldata assets,
        uint256[] calldata amounts,
        uint256[] calldata modes,
        address mainToken,
        bytes calldata params
    ) external onlyFlashLoan {
        address receiverAddress = address(this);

        // the various assets to be flashed

        // the amount to be flashed for each asset

        // 0 = no debt, 1 = stable, 2 = variable

        address onBehalfOf = address(this);
        // bytes memory params = "";
+       isFlashLoan = true;
        lendingPool.flashLoan(receiverAddress, assets, amounts, modes, onBehalfOf, params, Types.REFERRAL_CODE);
+       isFlashLoan = false;
        emit FlashLoans(assets, amounts, modes, mainToken);
    }

    function executeOperation(
        address[] calldata _assets,
        uint256[] calldata _amounts,
        uint256[] calldata _premiums,
        address _initiator,
        bytes calldata _params
    ) external override onlyLendingPool returns (bool) {
+       require(isFlashLoan);

        ...
    }
```
