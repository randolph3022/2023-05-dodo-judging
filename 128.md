```solidity
    function withdrawETH(bool _margin, uint256 _marginAmount, uint8 _flag) external payable onlyUser {
        if (_margin) {
            _lendingPoolWithdraw(address(WETH), _marginAmount, _flag);
        }
        WETH.withdraw(_marginAmount);
        _safeTransferETH(msg.sender, _marginAmount);
        emit WithdrawETH(_marginAmount, _margin, _flag);
    }
```
