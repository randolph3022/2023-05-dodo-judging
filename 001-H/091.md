# An Attacker Can Perform A Griefing Attack on Margin Trading Users by Exploiting the `executeOperation` Function and Using the Margin Trading Contract as the Receiver Address

## Summary
The [MarginTrading.executeOperation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/930565dd875dac24609441423c7c76c2ae4719a8/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L121) function modifier doesn't rightly protect the users from an attack where an attacker calls [Aaves LendingPool.flashLoan](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/30a2a19f6d28b6fb8d26fc07568ca0f2918f4070/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L481) using the users Margin Trading contract address as the receivers address.

Here's an example attack path as explained by an Aave developer:

## Vulnerability Detail
By examining [Aave's LendingPool.flashLoan](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/30a2a19f6d28b6fb8d26fc07568ca0f2918f4070/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L481) function, it becomes clear that any address can be specified as the receiver, as long as it implements `Aave's IFlashLoanReceiver` interface.

Here's an example attack path:
1. Attacker calls [Aave LendingPool.flashLoan](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/30a2a19f6d28b6fb8d26fc07568ca0f2918f4070/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L481) function with a `MarginTrader` user contract address as `receiver` and some specially crafted `params`.
2. `LendingPool.flashLoan` calls receiver's address [executeOperation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/930565dd875dac24609441423c7c76c2ae4719a8/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L121) function
3. `executeOperation` `onlyLendingPoo`l modifier checks if the calling address is the lending pool, this check passes

 Attacker can now choose to:

--> Close all of a user positions

--> Open bad trading positions

The attacker can repeatedly execute these transactions, closing or opening trades as desired, causing significant financial losses to their victims

Note that, since the attacker controls the input params, he can choose to not call `swapAddress` but rather make further external calls

```solidity

            (bool success,) = _swapAddress.call(_swapParams);
            require(success, "dodoswap fail");
```


## Impact
Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a griefing attack on `Margin Trading` users by manipulating their positions and causing substantial financial losses.

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation
Here's my suggestion, 
Aave [LendingPool.flashLoan](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/30a2a19f6d28b6fb8d26fc07568ca0f2918f4070/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L481) function adds the `msg.sender` as the initiator when calling the `executeOperation` function

```solidity
    require(
      vars.receiver.executeOperation(assets, amounts, premiums, msg.sender, params),
      Errors.LP_INVALID_FLASH_LOAN_EXECUTOR_RETURN
    );
```
I will recommend adding this  

```solidity
 function executeOperation(
        address[] calldata _assets,
        uint256[] calldata _amounts,
        uint256[] calldata _premiums,
        address _initiator,
        bytes calldata _params
    ) external override onlyLendingPool returns (bool) { 
        //decode params exe swap and deposit
        require(_initiator == address(this);


          . . . . .
     }
```

With this check, only the `lending pool` contract will be able to call this function and the `initiator` must be from the Margin Trading user contract address.
