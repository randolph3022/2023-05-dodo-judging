# MarginTrading could be drained of funds by malicious user

## Summary
MarginTrading could be drained by malicious user.

## Vulnerability Detail

AAVE Flash Loans are uncollateralised loans that allow the borrowing of an asset, as long as the borrowed amount (and a fee) is returned before the end of the transaction.

Anyone can call AAVE LendingPool contract, requesting a Flash Loan of a certain amounts of reserves using [flashLoan()](https://github.com/developers/v/2.0/the-core-protocol/lendingpool#flashloan), the flash loan fee will be paid by flash loan receiver, so if an unsuspecting contract with a non-reverting fallback function is specified as receiver, it could be drained of funds up to its allowance or balance limit.

In MarginTrading.sol, [executeOperation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L121-L127) is defined as AAVE LendingPool flashloan callback function, it doesn't validate if loan initiator is trusted, so when malicious user calls [flashLoan()](https://github.com/developers/v/2.0/the-core-protocol/lendingpool#flashloan) with MarginTrading being specified as receiver, the function won't revert and flash loan would be executed and repaid, plus any fees, as a result, funds in MarginTrading are drained.
