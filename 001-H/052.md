# Everyone can open or close positions from user

## Summary
MargineTrading.sol  uses the executeOperation() callback to open or close positions. This callback will be called after executeflashloan(). Execute flashloan can should only be called by approved contracts, or the user himself.
The issue here is that every flashloan, that is directed to the MargineTrading.sol contract calls executeOperation, and executeOperation doesn't check if the original caller is User or not. This will give anyone the possibility to call this function.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. User A creates margine tranding contract, and opens a trade using the factory
2. User B sees the trade, and closes it on behalft of user A
3. OR User B closes all open position on certain market, which can cause rapide price changes 

## Impact
Potential loss of funds, unexpected behavior.
