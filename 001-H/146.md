# Attacker can drain assets from MarginTrading by greifing attack

## Summary
Attacker can drain assets from MarginTrading by utilizing flashloan premium, due to lacking of validation of _initiator.

## Vulnerability Detail
In MarginTrading.sol, [**executeFlashLoans()**](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L89-L108) method is defined for user to execute a flash loan, and modifier [onlyFlashLoan](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L43-L50) is used to ensure that only authorized caller can execute this function:
```solidity
    modifier onlyFlashLoan() {
        require(
            _USER == msg.sender || owner() == msg.sender
                || IMarginTradingFactory(owner()).isAllowedProxy(address(this), msg.sender),
            "caller is unauthorized"
        );
        _;
    }
```
This function calls [__flashloan()__](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/ce53c4a8c8620125063168620eba0a8a92854eb8/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L483-L564)  from AAVE v2 LendingPool to execute a flash loan:
```solidity
        lendingPool.flashLoan(receiverAddress, assets, amounts, modes, onBehalfOf, params, Types.REFERRAL_CODE);
```
LendingPool will then call the callback function [__executeOperation()__](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L121-L166) on MarginTrading:
```solidity
    require(
      vars.receiver.executeOperation(assets, amounts, premiums, msg.sender, params),
      Errors.LP_INVALID_FLASH_LOAN_EXECUTOR_RETURN
    );
```
It could be seen that there is no validation for if [_initiator](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L125) is trusted, so attacker can call __flashloan()__ in AAVE LendingPool with [receiverAddress](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/ce53c4a8c8620125063168620eba0a8a92854eb8/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#LL484C13-L484C28) being MarginTrading, then [__executeOperation()__](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L121-L166) will be called on behalf of MarginTrading.
If user ever called [lendingPoolWithdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L172-L174) or [lendingPoolDeposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L180-L182) method in MarginTrading, then it's possible that user has granted unlimited allowance to __LendingPool__ through [___approveToken__](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L392-L396):
```solidity
    function _approveToken(address _address, address _tokenAddress, uint256 _tokenAmount) internal {
        if (IERC20(_tokenAddress).allowance(address(this), _address) < _tokenAmount) {
            IERC20(_tokenAddress).approve(_address, type(uint256).max);
        }
    }
```
Flashloan on AAVE comes with premium, so if attacker executes flashloan with receiverAddress being MarginTrading, assets will be transferred from MarginTrading to LendingPool as flashloan fee, thus MarginTrading being drained.

## Impact

By utilizing flashloan premium, attacker can drain the assets from MarginTrading.

## Recommendation

Please consider to verify that the initiator is MarginTrading in  [__executeOperation()__](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L121-L166):
```solidity
        require(
            _initiator == address(this),
            "Untrusted loan initiator"
        );
```
