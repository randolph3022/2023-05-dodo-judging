# Missing initiator check could lead to griefing attacks

## Summary

The `MarginTrading` contract allows users to deploy positions and deposit into the Aave protocol via a flashloan. There is a callback function after executing a flashloan `executeOperation` where missing validation of the `_initiator` parameter could cause griefing.

## Vulnerability Detail

The victim deposits some funds into their `MarginTrading` position. A malicious contract could call `flashloan()` from the the `lendingPool` and pass the victim’s contract address as the `receiverAddress`. Because `_initiator` is not validated, the victim’s `MarginTrading` contract will then execute `executeOperation()` and as a result, they will have to repay the flashloan and any kind of debts assigned. 

## Impact

The victim user could lose funds due to a griefing attack. This was awarded a medium in severity because this requires a user to have funds in the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I recommend asserting that the `executeOperation()` `_initiator` parameter is equal to the user’s deployed `MarginTrading` contract. This can be done similarly to the following:

`require(_initiator == address(this), "Not this contract!");`
