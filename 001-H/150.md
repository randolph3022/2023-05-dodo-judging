# All tokens can be stolen from MarginTrading due to unsafe executeOperation

## Summary

MarginTrading contains an executeOperation function which is the Aave flashloan callback function. Anybody can initiate a flashloan from the Aave pool with an instance of the MarginTrading contract as the receiver address. They can set themselves as the _swapApproveTarget and then drain all tokens from the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Alice initiates a new instance of MarginTrading and deposits 1,000 USDC
2. Bob calls flashloan on the Aave lending pool with Alice's MarginTrading address as the receiver and himself as onBehalfOf. In the parameters of the flashloan, he provides USDC as the swapApproveToken, himself as the swapApproveTarget and swapAddress, and an empty array for tradeAssets.
4. executeOperation will execute the _opentrade function which will approve MarginTrading's full USDC balance to be spent by Bob.
5. Bob transfers all USDC tokens to himself.

## Impact

All tokens can be stolen from MarginTrading.
