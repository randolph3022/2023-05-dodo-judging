# Anyone can request aave flashloan on behalf of MarginTrading contract to make loses for it

## Summary
Anyone can request aave flashloan on behalf of MarginTrading contract to make loses for it
## Vulnerability Detail
`MarginTrading.executeOperation` function is going to be called [by aave only](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L127).

Aave will call this callback and will provide [`params` parameter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#LL126C24-L126C31) that is passed by flashloan iniator.

Originally `MarginTrading` contract supposes, that `initiator` of flashloan will be `MarginTrading` itself.
However it can be not like that. And this param [is not checked anywhere](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L125).
Aave allows anyone to call `flashLoan` function and [provide callback receiver](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/master/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L499). That means that anyone can call flashloan with requested assets and amounts and `params` that will be sent to the callback receiver. And they can provide any `MarginTrading` contract as receiver.

The purpose of attacker is to steal funds from contract. 
Attacker should use mode 0 flashloan, which [means that borrowed funds will be returned](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/master/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L521-L538). And make `MarginTrading` [pay flashloan fee to aave](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/master/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L534-L537). This is first part of attack to make `MarginTrading` contract approve some amount of tokens that should be returned as flashloan with premium.

Attacker can make this by crafting special `params` parameter, which should provide allowance to aave.
For example attacker can provide `flag == 1` [to make `openTrade` function to run](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L160-L163).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L257-L279
```solidity
    function _opentrade(
        address _swapAddress,
        address _swapApproveTarget,
        address[] memory _swapApproveToken,
        bytes memory _swapParams,
        address[] memory _tradeAssets
    ) internal {
        if (_swapParams.length > 0) {
            // approve to swap route
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < _swapApproveToken.length; i++) {
                IERC20(_swapApproveToken[i]).approve(_swapApproveTarget, type(uint256).max);
            }

            (bool success,) = _swapAddress.call(_swapParams);
            require(success, "dodoswap fail");
        }
        uint256[] memory _tradeAmounts = new uint256[](_tradeAssets.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _tradeAssets.length; i++) {
            _tradeAmounts[i] = IERC20(_tradeAssets[i]).balanceOf(address(this));
            _lendingPoolDeposit(_tradeAssets[i], _tradeAmounts[i], 1);
        }
        emit OpenPosition(_swapAddress, _swapApproveToken, _tradeAssets, _tradeAmounts);
    }
```

So what attacker need to do here is just to create approval for a fee to aave. To do that he will provide aave address as `_swapApproveTarget` and `_swapApproveToken` array will contain all borrowed tokens(maybe just 1 is enough). So now we have approved tokens to aave.
Then we can provide whatever we want into `_swapAddress` and `_swapParams`, just to make it pass. For example it can be any call to eoa.
And also we will provide `_tradeAssets` as empty array.

As result this function has approved uin256.max tokens to aave and aave will transfer premium. 

Now we can repeat attack(take another flashloan), however this time we don't need to provide approve to aave, it's already done(so we just need to have some amount of borrowed token to be in contract to pay premium). This time we will approve tokens that we need to steal to our address. So after second flashloan is executed we can transfer all tokens from MarginTrading to our account.
## Impact
Users `MarginTrading` contract can be drained.

## Recommendation
You need to check that `initiator` of callback is `MarginTrading`.
