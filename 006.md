# `MarginTrading.sol` Lacks Permission Check, Exposing Funds to Theft

## Summary

The `MarginTrading.sol` contract neglects [AAVE's warning](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/92391/explain-griefing-attack-on-aave-flash-loan/92457#92457) against storing funds within the same contract that receives a flash loan. 
This issue, combined with insufficient permission checking on the `executeOperation()` function and arbitrary external calls, allows attackers to directly control the `MarginTrading.sol` contract and steal all funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

AAVE v2 and v3 call `executeOperation()` [on the fund receiver address](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/29ff9b9f89af7cd8255231bc5faf26c3ce0fb7ce/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/FlashLoanLogic.sol#L101-L110) without verifying the sender.
The check in `MarginTrading.executeOperation()` only confirms if `msg.sender` is [from an AAVE lending pool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L127), not if the original sender `_initiator` is a permissioned user.

This vulnerability allows attackers to create fake contract calls to the AAVE pool with `MarginTrading.sol` as the target receiver.
They can then access the internal functions `_closetrade()` and `_opentrade()`, which [permit arbitrary calls](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L270-L271) to any address with user-crafted calldata.
As a result, attackers can call any address and steal funds from the `MarginTrading.sol` contract.

## Impact

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to steal all funds from the `MarginTrading.sol` contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add an extra permission check for the `_initiator` address, accepting only `_initiator == address(this)` or ensuring that only the `MarginTrading.sol` contract can execute the `executeOperation()` function.

Alternatively, enhance administrative control by replacing arbitrary address calls with fixed DODO swap addresses or approved addresses from `MarginTradingFactory.sol`.
