# `executeFlashLoans` does not verify that assets and amounts are the same length

## Summary
Assets array and the amounts array need to have the same length. contract does not check if the lengths are the same before making the flashloan request
## Vulnerability Detail
Aave docs clearly state that 

> Amounts of assets being requested for flash borrow. This needs to contain the same number of entries as assets.

## Impact
Flashloan will revert if the assets and the amounts supplied are not the same length
